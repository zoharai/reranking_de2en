Obama receives Netanyahu
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not exactly friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and about Teheran 's destabilising activities in the Middle East .
the meeting was also planned to cover the conflict with the Palestinians and the disputed two state solution .
relations between Obama and Netanyahu have been strained for years .
Washington criticises the continuous building of settlements in Israel and accuses Netanyahu of a lack of initiative in the peace process .
the relationship between the two has further deteriorated because of the deal that Obama negotiated on Iran 's atomic programme , .
in March , at the invitation of the Republicans , Netanyahu made a controversial speech to the US Congress , which was partly seen as an affront to Obama .
the speech had not been agreed with Obama , who had rejected a meeting with reference to the election that was at that time impending in Israel .
in 911 Call , Professor admits to Shooting Girlfriend
in a 911 call , his voice only slightly shaky , college professor Shannon Lamb told police he had shot his girlfriend and officers needed to get over to their house .
lamb made a point to say his `` sweet dog '' was there alive and probably upset , and said the dead woman 's family contacts could be found on her phone .
inside the home , officers found Amy Prentiss ' body and a hand-written note scribbled on a white legal pad : `` I am so very sorry I wish I could take it back I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me , '' read the letter authorities say was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb , who was teaching two online classes for Delta State University in Cleveland , Mississippi , had already traveled 300 miles to the school 's campus , where police believe he shot and killed a well-liked history professor , Ethan Schmidt , in the doorway to his office .
Delta State University police chief Lynn Buford said university officials heard about the shooting at 10 : 18 a.m.
he said Lamb made the fateful 911 call sometime after that .
by the end of the day , there would be one more death : lamb took his own life as police closed in on him .
a day after the school shooting forced students and faculty to hide behind locked doors , authorities were still trying to piece together what motivated Lamb .
the details released by investigators at both ends of the state as well as students and staff who knew him helped paint a picture of a talented but possibly troubled teacher .
students said they looked forward to his class .
police in Gautier , where Prentiss died , said he had no history of violence or criminal record .
Schmidt himself had included Lamb in a book he wrote where he acknowledged the `` wonderful people '' he shared his academic life with .
both taught in the Division of Social Sciences and History , which lists 17 faculty members , and many students took courses from both .
at the same time , there were some inclinations of problems .
a student who praised Lamb , Brandon beavers , said he also seemed agitated and jittery , `` like there was something wrong with him . ''
another student , Mikel Sykes , said Lamb told him he was dealing with stress at the end of the 2014-15 academic year .
lamb had earlier asked Delta State University for a medical leave of absence , saying he had a health issue of some sort .
this year , he was only teaching two online classes .
recent changes in the university 's hiring policies meant that the doctorate Lamb had worked so hard to earn would not guarantee him an automatic tenure track to become an assistant professor .
university President William LaForge said he did n't know of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt but `` obviously there was something in Mr. Lamb 's mind . ''
those are questions Lamb can no longer answer .
after fleeing the campus , police later picked up Lamb 's trail when he crossed back into Mississippi from Arkansas .
before he could be apprehended , Lamb killed himself with a single .38-caliber pistol in the backyard of a home about a mile south of his parents ' home on the outskirts of Greenville , Mississippi , said Washington County coroner Methel Johnson .
his car was still running in the driveway .
it was not immediately clear why Lamb went to that home , though Johnson said she believes he knew the people who lived there .
lamb grew up in the area .
lamb started working at the university , which has 3,500 students in a city of about 12,000 , in 2009 and taught geography and education classes .
he received a doctorate in education in the spring .
one of Lamb 's longtime friends described him as smart , charismatic and funny .
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met through mutual friends .
she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried for several years to teach her to play guitar .
he was quite the heartthrob back then .
all the girls would melt when he was around , said Hairston , now 40 and living in the Jackson suburb of Brandon .
lamb and Prentiss had apparently been dating for some time .
in the 911 call , Lamb said `` I killed my wife , '' but there was no record of them ever marrying .
they had a dog named lightning that lived with them at the brick house that backs up to a bayou in Gautier .
police said the dog was OK .
Prentiss ' ex-husband , Shawn O 'Steen , said they divorced 15 years ago but remained friends and had a daughter who 's now 19 .
`` She was completely devastated , '' O 'Steen said of his daughter .
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O 'Steen said he had not met Lamb but heard through his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and played the blues .
lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both performed at a summer fair three years ago .
later , they played together in the occasional gig .
O 'Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music .
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various companies online .
Mike Shaffer , a bartender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room , a dimly lit bar near Gautier , said he last saw Lamb and Prentiss the night of Sept . 5 , after Lamb had finished playing his guitar and harmonica for a sparse crowd .
there was no sign of anything amiss .
`` Just a happy couple , '' he said .
we were cutting up and throwing one-liners at each other .
I mean , they both had a good sense of wit about them .
Schmidt , the slain professor , directed the first-year seminar program and specialized in Native American and colonial history , said Don Allan Mitchell , an English professor at the school .
he was married and had three young children .
he studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his fraternity and student government .
on the Delta State campus in Cleveland on Tuesday night , about 900 people , including faculty members , staff , students , and members of the community , attended a candlelight memorial .
Schmidt 's wife , Liz , and brother Jeff Schmidt also attended the vigil , during which the university choir sang `` bright Morning Star '' and `` amazing Grace . ''
classes resume Wednesday .
`` We 're trying to get our students to come back , '' LaForge said .
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland , Mississippi .
associated Press writers Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville , Mississippi , and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story has been corrected to reflect that police are now saying Lamb made the 911 call after shooting Schmidt , and that while Lamb referred to Prentiss as his wife in the 911 call , there is no indication the two ever married .

Michael J. Fox jokes About His ' date ' With Princess Diana
the premiere of `` Back to the Future '' was a huge moment for Michael J. Fox professionally .
it was noteworthy because of personal reasons , too .

UN Chief Says There Is No Military Solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says his response to Russia 's stepped up military support for Syria is that `` there is no military solution '' to the nearly five-year conflict and more weapons will only worsen the violence and misery for millions of people .
the U.N. chief again urged all parties , including the divided U.N. Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution .
ban told a news conference Wednesday that he plans to meet with foreign ministers of the five permanent council nations - the U.S. , Russia , China , Britain and France - on the sidelines of the General Assembly 's ministerial session later this month to discuss Syria .
he expressed regret that divisions in the council and among the Syrian people and regional powers `` made this situation unsolvable . ''
ban urged the five permanent members to show the solidarity and unity they did in achieving an Iran nuclear deal in addressing the Syria crisis .
8 Poll Numbers That Show Donald trump Is For Real
some have tried to label him a flip-flopper .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
and some are holding out for an implosion .
but no matter how some Republicans are trying to drag Donald trump down from atop the polls , it has n't worked -LRB- yet -RRB- .
ten of the last 11 national polls have shown Donald trump 's lead at double digits , and some are starting to ask seriously what it means for the real estate mogul 's nomination chances .
of course , it 's still early in the election cycle .
none of this is to say that trump is likely to win the Republican nomination .
pundits point out that at this time in 2011 , Rick Perry 's lead was giving way to a rising Herman Cain , neither of whom won even one state in the nomination process .
and there are many reasons he would struggle in a general election .
but outside groups like Jeb Bush 's Super PAC and the economic conservative group Club for Growth are recognizing trump 's staying power and beginning to unload their dollars to topple him .
here are some recent poll numbers that suggest that the real estate mogul is n't just a passing phase :
trump 's favorability ratings have turned 180 degrees .
right before Donald trump announced his candidacy in mid-June , a Monmouth University poll showed only two in 10 Republicans had a positive view of the real estate mogul .
by mid-July , it was 40 percent .
in early August , it was 52 percent .
now , six in 10 Republicans have a favorable view of Donald trump .
roughly three in 10 say they have a negative view .
and these numbers hold up in early states .
a Quinnipiac poll in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans there had a favorable view of trump .
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy with trump as the nominee .
in a CNN / ORC poll last week , 67 percent of Republicans said they would be either `` enthusiastic '' or `` satisfied '' if trump were the nominee .
only two in 10 say they would be `` upset '' if he were the nominee .
only Ben Carson generates roughly the same level of enthusiasm as trump -LRB- 43 percent say they would be `` enthusiastic '' vs. 40 percent who say the same of trump -RRB- .
the next closest in enthusiasm ?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent .
on the flip side , 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be `` dissatisfied '' or `` upset '' if establishment favorite Jeb Bush becomes the nominee .
a majority of Republicans do n't see trump 's temperament as a problem .
while Donald trump has been widely criticized for his bombast and insults , 52 percent of leaned Republican voters nationwide think that the real estate mogul has the right temperament to be president , according to Monday 's ABC News / Washington Post poll .
the same number holds in the first-in-the-nation caucus state of Iowa , where the same 52 percent of Republicans think he has the personality to be commander in chief , according to Quinnipiac last week .
still , 44 percent think he does n't have the personality to serve effectively , and almost six in 10 independents say his temperament does not belong in the White House , according to ABC / Post .
Republican voters are getting used to the idea .
when they put on their pundit hats , Republican voters think trump is for real .
when asked who is most likely to win the GOP nomination , four in 10 said trump was the best bet , according to a CNN / ORC poll out last week .
that 's a change from when four in 10 placed their money on Jeb Bush in late July .
full disclosure : GOP voters have n't had the clearest crystal ball in the past .
at this time last cycle , four in 10 Republicans picked Rick Perry to win the nomination , vs. only 28 percent for eventual nominee Mitt Romney .
still , it shows that a plurality of GOP voters see trump 's campaign as plausible .
even if Republicans rallied around another candidate , trump still beats almost everyone .
some pundits point out that the splintered field is likely contributing to trump 's lead , while anti-Trump support is be spread diffusely among more than a dozen other candidates .
but a Monmouth University poll in early September shows that , in a hypothetical head-to-head matchup between trump and most other Republican candidates , trump almost always garners majority support .
he leads Carly Fiorina by 13 points , Marco Rubio by 14 points , Walker by 15 points , Jeb Bush by 19 points , and , finally , Rand Paul , John Kasich and Chris Christie by 33 points each .
he 's in a dead heat with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Carson would lead the businessman by a wide 19 points in a hypothetical head-to-head .
a bare majority of Donald trump 's supporters say they 've made up their minds .
a new CBS / NYT poll out on Tuesday shows that just more than half of voters who support trump say they have locked in their votes .
obviously , a lot can happen to change that , and no one can really say they would never change their mind .
46 percent said they are leaving the door open to switching candidates .
still , trump 's strongest competition at the moment is from fellow outsider neurosurgeon Ben Carson , but voters who say they have made up their minds are twice as likely to go for trump .
six in 10 Republicans say they agree with trump on immigration .
even since Donald trump called immigrants from Mexico `` rapists '' in his campaign announcement speech two months ago , immigration has been front and center in the 2016 conversation .
some are worried that trump 's bombast will drive crucial Hispanic voters away from the Republican Party and damage rebranding efforts .
but according to Monday 's new ABC / Post poll , six in 10 Republicans say they agree with trump on immigration issues .
so as long as immigration remains in the spotlight , it seems Donald trump will remain too .
frustration with government is climbing to new highs .
Donald trump and Ben Carson now account for roughly half of the support from Republican voters , largely due to their outsider status .
six in 10 Republicans in Monday 's new ABC / Post poll say they want a political outsider over someone with government experience .
and they are angry at Washington , too .
a Des Moines Register / Bloomberg poll in Iowa from two weeks ago shows that three in four Iowa Republicans are frustrated with Republicans in Congress , with 54 percent `` unsatisfied '' and 21 percent `` mad as hell . ''
Munich , Sylt und Co . : the five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
the most expensive residential developments are located here in Hobookenweg - with a view over the North Sea mudflats .
on this road one square metre of a thatched house costs an average of € 73,300 .
`` On Sylt , the number of properties on offer is naturally limited , '' says a study - hence the high prices .
this new study indicates the particular locations with the most expensive accommodation per square metre .
of course , € 18.70 per square metre for student digs in Munich is not really low .
compared with Germany 's top areas , however , this price seems likes peanuts .
property service Engel & Volkers has published a league table of the most exclusive residential areas in Germany - with staggeringly high prices per square metre .
more than € 10,000 is nothing there - per quare metre , mind you .
OK , if you ca n't afford it ...
incidentally , for once Munich is not in the lead .
champions League : Bayern off to a dream start thanks to Müller and Götze
double goal scorer in Piraeus : Bayern star Thomas Müller is simply on a roll .
a lucky goal from Thomas Müller paved the way for a 3 : 0 victory for FC Bayern at Olypiacos Piraeus - then it got better .
a confident start to the Champions League season .
world champions Thomas Müller and Mario Götze brought about a dream start to their `` Milan Mission '' in the seething cauldron at Pireaus .
trainer pep Guardiola 's team won their opening match in the Champions League in a hot atmosphere away to the Greek record holders , thanks to Müller 's brace -LRB- 52nd and 90th minutes + 2 -RRB- and Götze 's goal -LRB- 89th minute -RRB- , ending in a score of 3 : 0 -LRB- 0 : 0 -RRB- .
the twelfth successful start in a row should be the first step toward the final in Italy on 28 May 2016 , where Guardiola wants to end his third attempt by taking the trophy back to Munich .
with his 28th goal in the Champions League , Müller took Bayern into the lead with the gracious help of Olymiacos goalie Roberto , who let through a cross shot from the world champion .
`` We are n't going to underestimate them , '' promised Bayern captain Phillipp Lahm before the game in the Karaiskakis Stadium in front of 31,688 hot-blooded fans - and the Munich player kept his word .
they demonstrated a concentrated and committed performance without being showy .
Piraeus had won their six most recent premiere class home games , including against prominent clubs such as Manchester United , Atletico Madrid and Juventus Turin .
in 2011 Borussia Dortmund stumbled here too .
but Bayern , undefeated in seven Europa Cup duels with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
they went to work boldly , but often too uninspired in their offensive efforts .
attacks were too often initiated by bringing left winger Douglas Costa , who rarely got past former Brunswick player Omar Elabdellaoui , into play .
Müller had more luck from the right when his cross shot from right field drove into the top left corner of the goal .
in the 67th minute the world champion missed the chance of taking the match to 2 : 0 .
Robert Lewandowski had the best opportunities in the first half .
first when Olympiacos striker Ideye Brown hit the Pole 's header from the line in the 26th minute .
then with a shot which the goalie parried with his knee in the 35th minute .
although Bayern is used to playing a dominant game , Piraeus were able to needle them .
but they could count on goalkeeper Manuel Neuer .
for example when he steered a shot from Ideye over the crossbar in the 56th minute .
Guardiola had a four-man backfield defence deployed in front of Neuer , with David Alba in the centre next to Jerome Boateng .
Mario Götze , back in the squad following muscle problems , initially sat on the sidelines .
the world cup hero had only been given the green light following final training , said Sporting Director Matthias Sammer on Sky : `` If anyone wants to make something else out of that , they are being malicious . ''
at the first change , Guardiola decided against him , when he brought in Kingsley Coman for the stricken Lewandowski in the 59th minute .
Götze came late for Arturo Vidal in the 76th minute and proved himself 13 minutes later ; Müller put another one in with a penalty .
before the match there was a riot in the stadium .
after a small group of Bayern fans , some wearing masks , had apparently provoked supporters of hosts Piraeus from behind their fence with words and gestures , security forces attacked them and used batons against the Munich supporters .
at least one Bayern fan was taken injured from the stadium .
smokers at a greater risk of losing teeth
smokers damage not only their lungs but also their teeth , concludes a long-term study in Potsdam .
the good news is : if you give up the risk decreases fast .
smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
this emerges from a long-term study by an international team of researchers , including a number of employees of the German Institute for Nutritional Research -LRB- DIfE -RRB- in Potsdam .
compared to non-smokers , the risk of losing their teeth prematurely is between 2.5 and 3.6 times higher for smokers .
the scientists monitored more than 23,300 participants .
the main reasons for tooth loss are caries and inflammation of the gums , the DIfE states .
smoking is a risk factor for this periodontitis , emphasise the authors .
the connection between smoking and loss of teeth can therefore be attributed to more frequent gum inflammation in smokers .
it has not been clarified to what extent smoking raises the risk of caries .
people who stop smoking could reduce their risk within a short time , the researchers write in the `` Journal of dental Research . ''
it could however take 10 years before the danger once more drops to the level of non-smokers ' , declared lead author Thomas Dietrich of the University of Birmingham in England .
people should be persuaded to become non-smokers , declared study leader Heiner Boeing of DIfE : `` Smoking shortens the lifespan . ''
not smoking is good for the lungs and vessels and in our experience leads to good dental health to an advanced age .
in Germany over 20 percent of the population in the 65 to 74 age group are affected by toothlessness , according to the DIfE .
earlier studies had already indicated that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long term study substantiates these findings .
archaeologists discover ancient remains on the banks of the Rhine at Cologne
archaeological finds have again been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne .
archaeologists from the Roman Germanic Museum have unearthed skeletons and remains of historical buildings near the site where the new Rhine Boulevard is being constructed , said museum Director Marcus Trier on Tuesday .
historians have been in search of so-called architectural monuments since the start of construction work on the Rhine .
the museum , as the department for archaeological monument conservation , is always consulted when construction projects are carried out in the city district of Cologne .
the archaeologists made a find in the third construction phase of the Rhein Boulevard .
it is already known from text documents that a fortress stood on this spot in the 4th century , and in the 8th century a church , explained Trier .
besides the remains of the fortress and the church tower , a cemetery with around 350 graves , which probably belonged to the church , has also been discovered .
young woman hit by goods train
after a young woman met with an accident at the station in Geilenkirchen-Lindern , police are asking for help from the general public .
early on Wednesday morning , at about 1 : 40 a.m. , the young woman crossed the tracks at the end of the platform coming from the direction of the station building and was hit by a goods train coming from the direction of Mönchengladbach .
according to the Federal police she suffered severe injuries from the accident .
she was treated at the site by an emergency doctor and taken to hospital by ambulance .
investigating officers have no idea why the young woman was crossing the tracks at night .
it is possible that the event was observed by witnesses or residents may have heard something .
this may apply to residents of or people passing by the Lindern station , Ziegelbäckerweg , Thomashofstrasse and Leiffarther Strasse -LRB- L364 -RRB- .
any information that can be provided about the cause of the accident can be given by calling the free 24-hour police hotline on 0800 / 688 8000 or at any police station .
EU Commission proposes new court in controversy over TTIP
to defuse the controversy over the planned Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership , TTIP , the EU Commission has proposed a substantial reform of the current arbitration system .
according to this , the disputed private arbitration board for conflicts between corporations and countries would be replaced by a transparent system which corresponds considerably more in its function to traditional courts .
`` We want to set up a system which citizens trust , '' stated the responsible EU Commissioner , Cecilia Malström , when introducing it .
the Swede plans to introduce the proposal as the European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the USA .
the German government has announced its support .
the creation of TTIP will result in the largest free trade zone in the world , covering 800 million people .
plans for reform of the current arbitration procedure specifically provide for the EU states and the USA to jointly select independent judges for a new investment court .
they should come in equal proportions from the EU , the USA and from non-member countries .
for the first time , a second instance is also provided for .
this would allow for appeals to be made against judgements .
up to now , the parties to proceedings have agreed on the arbitrator among themselves and there has been no possibility of appeal against their judgements .
in the discussions over the past months it has become clear that citizens do not trust the old ISDS system to be fair and just , commented Malström .
