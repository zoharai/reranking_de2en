Obama Meets Netanyahu
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not very friendly .
The two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and about Tehran 's destabilizing actions in the Middle East .
At the meeting , however , it should also deal with the conflict with the Palestinians and the joint two-state solution .
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been tense for years .
Washington criticises the continuing construction of Israel and rejects Netanyahu 's lack of will in the peace process .
Through the Obama deal about Iran 's nuclear program , the relationship between the two has deteriorated further .
In March , Netanyahu made a controversial speech to the US Congress at the invitation of the Republicans , partly viewed as an affront to Obama .
The speech was not discussed with Obama , a meeting that was rejected with reference to the forthcoming election in Israel .
In an emergency call , Professor allowed to shoot his girlfriend
In an emergency call , Professor Shannon Lamb told the police with a little voice of the police , that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials would have to come to his house .
Lamb was important to emphasise that his `` sweet dog '' is still alive and probably excited , and he said that the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone .
Inside the house , the officials found the corpses of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note that was glued to a white block : `` I am so sorry , I could do it , I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me , '' and he was signed by Lamb .
There was no evidence that lamb , which was taught in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland , Mississippi , had already traveled 300 miles to the school where , according to the police , he shot a popular history professor , Ethan Schmidt , who shot and killed his office at the door .
Delta State University police chief Lynn Buford said that university employees have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 .
He said that lamb made the fateful emergency call at some point in the day .
Until the end of the day there was another death : Lamb died when the police took him .
A day after the shooting at the university , which forced students and lecturers to hide behind closed doors , the authorities are still trying to get an image of what lamb motivated .
The details published by the investigators at both ends of the state , like what students and employees who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented but potentially difficult teacher .
Students said that they were happy with his teaching .
The police in Gautier , where Prentiss died , said that he had no history of violence or a criminal history .
Schmidt himself mentioned Lamb in a book written by him , in which he mentioned the `` wonderful people , '' with whom he shared his academic life .
Both were in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty includes 17 members , and many students attended courses of both .
At the same time , there were some tendencies to problematic behaviors .
A student , Brandon beavers who praised the Lamb , said he seemed a little excited and nervous , `` as if something was wrong with him . ''
Another student , Mikel Sykes , said that lamb told him that he had stress at the end of the academic year 2014-15 .
Lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said that he had any health problem .
This year , he taught only two online courses .
Recent changes in the university 's employment policy meant that the promotion , for which lamb had worked so hard , would not give him any guarantee of an automatic path to a job as an assistant professor .
University President William LaForge said that he did not know about a conflict between lamb and Schmidt , but `` of course , there was something in Mr Lambs . ''
These are questions that lamb can no longer answer .
After the flight from the campus , the police later found Lambs when he went back to Mississippi from Arkansas .
Before he could be arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .38 caliber gun in the backyard of a house in the backyard of a house on the outskirts of Greenville , Mississippi , said Washington County Coroner methel Johnson .
His car was still in the entrance .
It was not immediately clear why lamb went to this House , but Johnson said that she believed he knew the people who lived there .
Lamb grew in the area .
Lamb began its work at the university in 2009 , which has 3,500 students in a city of about 12,000 inhabitants , and taught geography and pedagogy .
He holds a doctorate in pedagogy in the spring .
One of the long-time friends of Lambs described him as intelligent , charismatic and funny .
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when she met with joint friends .
She and her friends were in the High School , and he was the cool older guy who tried to play the guitar game for some years .
At that time , he was the hotbed of women .
All girls melted away when he was there , said Hairston , now 40 and in the Jackson Vorstadt of Brandon resident .
Lamb and prentiss obviously had some time together .
In the emergency call , lamb `` I killed my wife '' but there was no certificate of marriage .
They had a dog called lightning , who lived with them in the brick house bordering on a Bayou in Gautier .
The police said that the dog was in order .
The ex-husband of Prentiss , Shawn O 'Steen , said that they were divorced 15 years ago , but left friends and had a daughter who was now 19 years old .
`` She was totally destroyed by the ground , '' O 'Steen said about his daughter .
She and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O 'Steen said that he had never met lamb , but through his daughter Abigail he heard that lamb was interested in music and played blues .
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail appeared on a summer market three years ago .
Later they played together with one or two Gig .
O 'Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music .
Prentiss was a nurse who worked online for several companies .
Mike Shaffer , a barkeeper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room , a weakly lit bar near Gautier , said that he saw Lamb and Prentiss Night in the night 5 September the last time , after Lamb had finished his guitar and oral harmonica before a little audience .
There was no evidence that anything was wrong .
`` Just a happy couple , '' he said .
We were at the reception and shook each other .
I think that they both had a good sense of joke .
Schmidt , the dead professor , directed the first semester seminar program and specialized in American native and colonial history , said Don Allan Mitchell , an English professor at school .
He was married and had three small children .
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his brotherhood and the student committee .
On the Delta State Campus in Cleveland , about 900 people , including faculty , staff , students , and members of the community , participated in a candlelight celebration on Tuesday night .
Schmidt 's wife Liz and his brother , Jeff Schmidt , also participated in the memorial station , while the university sang `` Bright Morning Star '' and `` amazing Grace . ''
The lessons will be resumed on Wednesday .
`` We are trying to get our students to return , '' said LaForge .
The crisis is over .
This is a day of healing .
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland , Mississippi .
Associated Press authors Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville , Mississippi , and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
This story was corrected to reflect that the police are now saying that lamb made the emergency call after he had shot Schmidt , and that lamb in his emergency call may have called Prentiss as his wife , but there is no evidence that the two have ever been married .
Toys R Us plans to stop less labor for Christmas time
Toys R Us says that there will not be as many Christmas loader employees as they were last year , but the toy and baby product dealer says that he will give the current employees and seasonal workers a chance to work for more hours .
The company said that it plans to hire 40,000 people in stores and distribution centers all over the country , and 45,000 people have been recruited during the Christmas period in 2014 .
Most jobs will be part-time jobs .
The company said that it will start this month with application calls and the number of employees rises between October and December .
While the holidays themselves are still months away , the Christmas business is approaching , and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to equip stores with employees who sell , send and deliver products .
Michael J. Fox shouts about his `` date '' with Princess Diana
The premiere of `` Back to the Future '' was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
It was also remarkable for personal reasons .
`` We were waiting for the royalty at the theatre , and I realize that the seat is next to me , and I gradually realize that Princess Diana will sit next to me , '' he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary `` Back in Time . ''
The film is starting , and it seems to me that I am a simulated mover and an armes-length of being the Princess of Wales at a date .
`` Back in Time , '' a documentary about `` Back to the Future , '' presents interviews with Fox , Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd , as well as director Robert Zemeckis and the producer Steven Spielberg .
`` Back for the Future '' had a premiere 30 years ago .
`` It 's for me really , '' said Spielberg , `` the biggest time film that has ever been shot . ''
`` Back in Time '' will be on VOD , DVD and in selected cinemas in October .
UN leader says that there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says his response to Russia 's increased military support for Syria is : `` There is no military solution '' of the almost five years of conflict , and more weapons will only worsen violence and misery for millions of people .
The UN leader is once again calling on all the parties , including the divided UN Security Council , to unite and to support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution .
Ban said at a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the foreign ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , the UK , and France - at the margins of the General Assembly of the General Assembly this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
He regretted that the events in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers `` make this situation insoluble . ''
Ban called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity that they have shown in reaching a nuclear deal with Iran in dealing with the crisis in Syria .
8 poll numbers that show that Donald trump is serious .
Some have tried to trade him as a flop .
Others dismissed him as a joke .
And some are waiting for collapse .
But , as some Republicans are trying to pull Donald trump from the top ranks at polls , it has not worked .
Ten of the last eleven national surveys showed that Donald trump was in double-digit terms , and some begin to ask seriously what it means for the chances of nominating the real estate mogul .
Of course , it is too early in the parliamentary term .
No one claims that trump will likely win the Republican nomination .
Experts stress that at this time in 2011 , Rick Perrys was led to the rising Herman Cain , of which none of them even won a state in the nomination process .
And there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
But outsiders such as Jeb Bush 's Super PAC and the conservative Business Group Club for Growth now recognize trump 's stamina , and begin to let their dollars go to topple it .
Here are some current poll figures that indicate that the real estate Mogul is not just a temporary phase :
Trump 's popularity ratings have shot at 180 degrees .
Shortly before Donald trump announced his candidacy in mid-June , a Monmouth-University poll showed that only two out of ten Republicans saw the real estate Mogul .
By mid-July , it was 40 percent .
At the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
Now , six out of 10 Republicans have a positive view of Donald trump .
About three out of ten say that they have a negative opinion .
And these figures continue in early states .
A Quinnipiac vote in Iowa found last week that 60 % of Republicans had a good opinion of trump .
Two-thirds of the GOP voters would be happy with trump as candidates .
In a poll of CNN / ORC last week , 67 % of Republicans said that they would be `` enthusiastic '' or `` satisfied '' if trump was nominated .
Only two from 10 say they are `` angry '' if he were the candidate .
Only Ben Carson creates about the same enthusiasm as trump -LRB- 43 % say they were `` enthusiastic '' vs. 40 percent , who say the same about trump -RRB- .
The next in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Rubio with only 21 % .
On the other hand , 47 % of Republican voters say that they were `` dissatisfied '' or `` angry '' when Jeb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate .
A majority of Republicans do not see trump 's temperament as a problem .
While Donald trump is widely criticized for his bombastic and insulting statements , 52 % of Irish voters believe that real estate Mogul has the right temperament for a president , said ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
The same number applies in the first pre-election state of the nation , the state of Iowa , where the same 52 % of the Republicans think that he has the personality of a commander-in-chief , according to Quinnipiac last week .
Nevertheless , 44 percent think that he does not have the personality to effectively execute his office , and almost six of 10 independents say that his temperament does not go to the White House , said ABC / Post .
Republican voters get used to the idea .
When they set up their bite heads , Republican voters hold trump in real terms .
When they are asked who is most likely to win the GOP nomination , according to a poll of CNN / ORC from last week , four of ten say that trump is the best bet .
This is a change since the time when four from 10 to the end of July put their money on Jeb Bush .
Full disclosure : GOP-voters did not have the clearest crystal ball in the past .
At that time in the last cycle , four of ten Republicans thought that Rick Perry would win the nomination to only 28 % for the final candidate Mitt Romney .
Nevertheless , a large number of GOP voters regard trump 's campaign as plausible .
Even if the Republicans collected a different candidate , trump beats almost everyone .
Some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to trump 's leadership , while anti-trust support is spread to more than a dozen other candidates .
But a survey by the Monmouth-University at the beginning of September shows that in a hypothetical head-to-head race between trump and most other Republican candidates , trump 's majority support has materialized .
He has 13 points before Carly Fiorina , before Marco Rubio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before Jeb Bush , 19 points and finally on Rand Paul , John Kasich and Chris Christie 33 points .
It is a head-to-head race with Ted Cruz .
The only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Carson would overtake the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypothetical head-to-head race .
A narrow majority of Donald trump fans say that they have formed their minds .
A new poll of CBS / NYT on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of the voters who support trump say that they have held their votes .
Of course , much can be done to change that , and no one can really say that we never have to change the opinion .
46 % said that they leave the door open to change to other candidates .
Yet trump 's strongest competitors at the moment of other outsiders , the neurochirurg Ben Carson , but voters who say that they have formed their minds are twice as common for trump .
Six out of 10 Republicans say that they agree with trump on immigration .
Since Donald trump 's campaign speech called immigrants from Mexico `` rapists '' two months ago , immigration was a pivotal point in public discourse in 2016 .
Some are concerned that the bombastic expression of trump will keep critical Hispano-American Americans out of the Republican Party and damage reorientation efforts .
But after the new ABC / post poll on Monday , six of 10 Republicans say that they coincide with trump in matters of immigration .
So , as long as immigration remains in the spotlight , Donald trump will appear to be so .
Frustration over the government falls on new highs .
Donald trump and Ben Carson now account for about half of the support of Republican voters , especially through their outsider status .
Six of 10 Republicans say in the new Monday poll of ABC / Post , they prefer to have a political outsider than someone with government experience .
And they are also angry at Washington .
A survey by Des Moines Register / Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three of four Irish Republican officials are frustrated with the Republicans in Congress , with 54 % `` dissatisfied '' and 21 % `` painfully angry . ''
Munich , Sylt and Co. : The five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
Here you will find the most expensive residential area , with views over the North Sea .
In the street , a square meter of a holiday house costs 73,300 euros .
`` On Sylt , the supply of objects is naturally limited , '' says the study - hence the high price .
A new study shows which special locations cost a square meter most .
Of course , 18.70 Euro per square meter for a student bus in Munich are not really little .
In contrast to Germany 's top living space , the price is the same as peanuts .
The property provider Engel & Völkers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential locations - with square metre prices in verging heights .
There are sometimes several tens of thousands of euros per square metre , but this is true .
But well , who can afford ...
By the way : Munich is not at the top here .
Champions League : Bayern-Tspace-start thanks to Müller and Götze
There are two ways of protecting ourselves in Piraeus : Bayern-Star star Thomas Müller simply has a run .
A lucky hit by Thomas Müller gave the FC Bayern the way to a deserved 3 : 0 in the case of Olympiakos Piraeus - then ran out .
A sovereign prelude to the Champions League 's season .
The World Champion Thomas Müller and Mario Götze have given the FC Bayern a dream start in the `` mission Milan . ''
The crew of trainer Pep Guardiola won the Champions League at the Greek record Olympic Championship in a hot atmosphere , thanks to Müller 's double pack -LRB- 52nd / 90 . + 2 -RRB- and Götzes hits -LRB- 89. -RRB- earned with 3 : 0 -LRB- 0 : 0 -RRB- .
The 12th success in the series should be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Guardiola wants to bring the Henkelpott to Munich in the third round .
During his 28th hit in the Champions League for Bayern-leadership , Müller received a warm welcome from the Olympic goalkeeper Roberto , who allowed the team to win a shot of the World Championship .
`` We will not underestimate them , '' Bayern-Captain Philipp paralym promised to play in the Karaiskakis stadium in front of 31.688 hottest fans - and the Munich held the floor .
They showed a concentrated and dedicated idea , without shining .
Piraeus won his last six home games in the premier class , including renowned clubs such as Manchester United , Atlético Madrid and Juventus Turin .
Borussia Dortmund -LRB- 1 : 3 -RRB- is also proud in 2011 .
But the Bavarians , in seven Europac-up duels with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
They went brave , but in their offensive efforts they were often too imaginative .
The attacks have been initiated too often via the relocation of the left wing , Douglas Costa , who has seldom come to grips with the former Braunschweig Omar Elabdellaoui .
From the right , Müller had more luck , as his flank from the right half-field on the left left at the upper gate .
In the 67th minute , the World Champion issued the possible 2 : 0 .
The best opportunities in half had Robert Lewandowski .
First , as Olympic striker Ideye Brown the headball of the Poland beat of the line -LRB- 26 -RRB- .
Then , by telephone , the goalkeeper Roberto parked with the knee -LRB- 35th -RRB- .
Although the Bavarians made their favourite game , Piraeus was able to set a needle .
But Manuel Neuer was on the way to the goalkeeper Manuel Neuer .
For example , when he drew a shot of Ideye via the bar -LRB- 56th -RRB- .
Before New , Guardiola had a four-legged stand with David Alaba in the center next to Jerome Boateng , who made it good .
Mario Götze , back to musculary problems back in the kite , sat outside .
The World Cup hero gave the green light only after the final training , said sports director Matthias Sammer at `` Sky '' : `` Who wants to do something else , that 's already malicious . ''
Even at the first change , Guardiola decided against him when he brought Kingsley Coman to the defeated farm -LRB- 59th -RRB- .
Götze came late for Arturo Vidal -LRB- 76th -RRB- and made everything clear 13 minutes later .
Before the match there was a tie in the stadium .
After a smaller group of partly interminable Bavarian fans seemed to have provoked the supporters of hosts Piraeus with words and gestures , the security forces attacked and attacked the Munich supporters .
At least a Bayer plane was carried away from the stadium .
People who smoke have a higher risk of losing teeth
People who smoke damage not only the lung but also the teeth - which suggests a long-term Potsdam study .
The good news : If you do n't , the risk will decline quickly .
Smokers have a much higher risk of losing their teeth early .
This emerges from the long-term study of an international research team , including several employees of the German Institute for Food Research -LRB- DIFE -RRB- in Potsdam .
Compared to non-smokers , the risk of losing your teeth prematurely , the 2.5 to 3.1 fold was higher .
The scientists had observed more than 23.300 participants .
The main causes of tooth failure are caries and inflammation of the gum , emphasizes the DIfE .
For these Parodontitis , smoking is a risk factor , emphasize the authors .
The link between smoking and the loss of teeth therefore results in more frequent gum infections in smokers .
It is not clear whether smoking also increases the risk of caries .
People who listened to smoking could reduce their risk in a short period of time , writing the researchers in the `` Journal of dental Research . ''
However , it could take more than ten years until the danger returns to the level of non-smokers , declared Dr. Thomas Dietrich of the English University of Birmingham .
It is necessary to persuade people to become non-smokers , said Heiner Boeing of the DIfE : `` smoking shortens the lifetime . ''
Not to smoke is good for lungs and vessels and , according to our findings , also results in good dental health up to the high age .
In Germany , more than 20 % of the population in the age of 65 to 74 years are affected by toothlessness , the DIfE said .
Previous studies have already indicated that smoking increases the risk of early teeth .
The new long-term study reinforces the findings .
Archaeologists meet on Cologne banks on remains of Late antiquity .
For the umpteenth time , archaeological finds have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne .
Near the building site for the new Rhine boulevard , archaeologists of the Roman-Germanic Museum have excavated skeletons and remains of historic buildings , said museum leader Marcus Trier on Tuesday .
Since the beginning of the construction works on the Rhine , historians have been searching for so-called ground monuments .
For all construction projects in the Cologne city district , the museum is always attracted as a specialist office for archaeological floor care .
In the third part of the Rhine Valley , the archaeologists now found themselves .
Text documents have already been known to have been a fortress in the 4th century and a church in the 8th century , explained Trier .
In addition to the remains of the fortress and the church tower , a cemetery with about 350 graves probably belonged to the church .
Young woman in the freight train
After a young woman at the railway station in Geilenkirchen , the Federal Police is asking the public to help .
At the end of the railway line , at the end of the railway line , on Wednesday morning , the woman crossed the track and was captured by a freight train that came from Mönchengladbach .
By collecting the train , it has borne the most serious injuries to it , according to the federal police .
She was treated on the spot as a doctor and brought to a hospital by rescue workers .
There is no evidence of the consequences of the crossing of young women in the night .
The incident may have been observed by witnesses or residents have heard acoustic perceptions .
People living in Linderner Bahn , brick bakery , Thomashofstraße and Leiffarther Straße -LRB- L364 -RRB- come into question .
Indications about the cause of the accident can be provided under 24 hours a free hotline of the Federal Police under phone 0800 / 6888000 or any other police service .
The European Commission is proposing a new court in dispute over TTIP
In order to defuse the dispute over the planned transatlantic free trade agreement , the European Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbitration system .
The controversial private arbitration bodies for disputes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which , in its operation , corresponds to much more traditional courts .
`` We want to set up a system that the citizens trust , '' the competent EU Commissioner Cecilia Malmström explained in the presentation .
The Swede has introduced the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade negotiations with the United States .
The German Government announced support .
TTIP is to create the largest free trade area in the world with 800 million people .
The plans for the reform of the current arbitration process suggest that the EU countries and the United States jointly elect independent judges for a new investment court .
They should come from the EU , the United States and third countries .
For the first time there is also a second instance .
It would allow it to appeal against verdicts .
So far , the participants in the process agreed to each other , and there was no possibility of a claim against their judgments .
In the discussion of the past few months , it became clear that citizens did not trust the old ISDS system in terms of fairness and justice , commented Malmström .
In the long term , it wants to work towards an international investment court .
For example , disputes between Chinese companies and EU countries could also be resolved .
The investor-state arbitration proceedings , which were mainly demanded by large corporations , are regarded as one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TTIP .
The traditional arbitration courts are criticized by opponents as a kind of parallel justice , through which companies can claim damages at the expense of taxpayers , national laws , or a reduction in consumer and environmental standards .
In the first statements , anti-TIP organisations such as Campact described the proposals of the EU Commission as inadequate .
The main criticism was that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada -LRB- CETA -RRB- .
The German Economic State Secretary , Matthias Machnig -LRB- SPD -RRB- , described the plans as great progress .
In the course of the reform , the Commission takes into account essential points , which Federal Economic Minister Sigmar Gabriel prepared with other EU trade ministers in the spring .
The old system of private arbitration is off the table .
The French Government also welcomed the plans of Malmström .
The European business association , Business Europe , warned that too many new rules would limit the possibilities of the economy .
Small and medium-sized enterprises in particular could be put at a disadvantage .
When the talks on the TTIP -LRB- Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership -RRB- can be concluded , it remained unclear on Wednesday .
The negotiations have been running since mid-2013 .
However , the issue of investor protection has not yet been discussed with the US .
Originally , a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year .
This date is no longer sustainable .
Hamburg , Germany , is a fine folk in Hamburg .
Before eleven years , Sufjan Stevens sits on stage in the Cologne Prime Club -LRB- today : Luxor -RRB- .
In addition to him , there is a flipchart , to which the timid folk singer has recorded the picturesque US state of Michigan with pencil .
The entire audience , about 40 people , is almost taken by Stevens talk .
He tells about various places that he repeatedly records on the map , reporting about his straight and zart arranged songs .
Where they were born and how it looks in his homeland .
Since then , Stevens has proven to be a wonderfully creative Irish .
With the third album `` greetings from Michigan : The Great Lake State '' in 2003 , songs that are very close to American folk in the late sixties can be drawn together , but can always be made into a much more opulent style .
The rumour , `` Michigan , '' would be the first part of a lost series : Each of the 50 US states should be remembered .
However , in 2004 and in the vicinity of the Rhine , `` Seven Swans '' have already appeared and are breaking certain expectations .
To reduce , Stevens will appear here .
Live are the guitar and the banjo .
A year later , the musicians living in New York are returning to the series .
With `` Illinois '' -LRB- `` Sufjan Stevens invites You To : Come on The Sparoise '' -RRB- is a widely acclaimed masterpiece in 2005 .
Brimming with ideas and stylistic finesse .
The album rises into the American billboard charts and lacks any annual list of influential music media .
After extremely productive experiments , Stevens then worked on `` The Age of Adz '' -LRB- 2010 -RRB- very extensive electronic copies .
This sixth full studio album is still widely orchestrated , but worn by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effect and hall .
Long ago of the smaller clubs , the stage shows become a colourful spectacle of Neon horn bands and large fluorescent stages .
Currently , Sufjan Stevens is part of a five-member band through Germany .
In the dark kept hamburger More !
He mainly presents the `` Carrie & Lowell '' which has been available since March .
Despite the fact that nearly 2000 guests are banned in their chairs , the much-vaunted Stevens is returning to intimacy and folk .
Without a word to the audience , the group of excellent musicians is playing through the widely enriched album .
From the audience you hear : The talk is `` opulent '' and you can actually throw the `` plate away . ''
Only with an addition , Stevens would like to be modest , playing a few older songs and finally breaking with applause .
Jeremy Corbyn 's debut at Question Time of the Prime Minister
Since his election , Mr Corbyn 's debut at Prime Minister 's Question Time is eagerly awaited
The new Labour Chairman Jeremy Corbyn is to make his debut at the Prime Minister 's Question Time and to join David Cameron for the first time .
Mr Corbyn will rise to ask the first of his six questions shortly after noon , with his performance probably being examined by the media and the Labour MEPs nearby .
He called for `` less theatre and more facts '' at this weekly event .
He also said that he could skip some meetings to leave them to their colleagues .
The meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Corbyns 's leadership , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TUC annual meeting on Tuesday .
In the meantime , the Labour Chairman 's decision to remain in silence during the dawn of the national anthem at a commemoration of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain provoked criticism of a number of Tory-MPs and is at the heart of several headlines stories in the newspapers .
Mr Corbyn 's decision not to sing the national anthem has attracted attention .
One speaker of Mr Corbyn said that he had `` stood in respectful silence '' and he had recognised the `` heroism of the Royal Air Force in the air pit around England . ''
But a member of Mr Corbyn 's shadow cabinet , Owen Smith , told the BBC Two News Program , he advised the Labour Chairman to sing the national anthem , `` regardless '' of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished .
Almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve Mr Corbyns 's top team , citing differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than one-sixth of the parliamentary party originally supported him as a leader .
The political correspondent of the BBC , Robin Brant , says that political differences are also `` stalling , '' according to Mr Corbett 's comments on the position of the European Union and the restriction on profits .
Mr Corbyn said to the TUC conference that Labour is making changes in order to remove the whole idea of a limit as a whole .
Hours later , Mr Smith , the shadow labour and pension minister said that the party `` very clear '' was that it was only against government plans to reduce the limit of £ 26,000 to £ 23.000 .
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader , since he is Mr Cameron , since he is Tory , over the last decade over the Dispatch box in Parliament .
The Labour Chair , who has promised a different political approach , says that he has `` Crowd-out '' ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and has given him more than 30,000 suggestions .
The Islington North MP has said that Prime Minister Question Time is too confrontational , and that it will refrain from `` dexterity , '' and that it has failed to focus on serious problems such as poverty , inequality , and the challenges for young people .
Mr Corbyn said that Angela Eagle , the shadow of the business minister , will represent him when he does not participate - for example when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
He also discussed the idea that other Members would sometimes take the floor , and that he raised John Berner , the spokesman for the House , to discuss the problem .
When he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said that he wanted to remove himself from the `` spell theater '' policy , which is often linked to Prime Minister Question Time , but a few years later he admitted that he failed .
As it was first broadcast on television in 1990 , Question Time with the Prime Minister was regarded as the most important barometer of a leader 's ruling and his leadership in the House of Commons and his position among his fellow Members , although critics argued that it had become a caricature and would require far-reaching reforms .
`` shot in Joburg '' : Homeless young people trained to photographers

Pound rises by accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
The pound soared to data showing an increase in UK wage growth , and , in parallel , the FTSE 100 has been increased by the SABMiller target .
Between May and July , the result grew by 2.9 % over the same period in the United Kingdom without bonuses in the United Kingdom .
Since 2009 , this percentage has been the fastest and provided assessment of the timing of an interest rate increase .
The pound rose by more than 1 % against the dollar to $ 1,5505 , and rose to 0.84 % against the Euro at € 1.3730 .
The FTSE 100 Index received an increase by 1.49 % to 6,229.21 .
SABMiller was the outstanding share on the market and made a jump of 20 % following the acquisition of the rival AB In .
A transaction would combine the two largest breweries in the world and combine brands such as Budweiser , Stella Artois , Peroni and Grolsch .
Burberry shares were 0.9 % higher after encouraging news from the rival Group for luxury goods .
Richemongering 's latest sales hit all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for burberry - are again reporting growth .
Glencore shares rose by 5 % after the Bergbauriese said that he took $ 2.5 billion through a share sale as part of his debt reduction strategy .
The shares of the packaging and paper company Mondi were the biggest losers in the index , with a decline of 4.3 % , after Goldman Sachs had rated his estimate for the firm 's rating .
JD Sports rose by 3.1 % after the sportswear company reported a pre-tax result of 46.6 million for the six months .
The head of JD Sports says that higher wages are threatening expansion .
The managing director of JD Sports Peter Cowgill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean `` more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . ''
But it is unlikely that this purchasing power will offset the higher labor costs of its company , he says .
The costs could hit the expansion plans of JD sports , he added , and that could mean that there are less additional jobs .
Justin Bieber in the capital : At the Bieber Expedition in Berlin
Justin Bieber , Megastar .
Merry 21 years young , a hanging object with a top flying crisis .
The guy with the platinblonden hair is EUR 100 million difficult .
More so .
Currently Monsieur Bieber is in Berlin .
And the generation U17 rotates .
How Wiktionary Rudzinska .
The 15-year-old has never heard the name `` Ritz Carlton . ''
Not a bad one .
Hundreds of fans accompanied Justin yesterday .
Including Ewa and Viktoria from Poland .
Since 7 o 'clock , however , the Polin sits on the cold stone slabs of the Berlin luxury hotel at Potsdamer Platz .
The Bieber-Bau : Here your idol , whose poster hangs in Stettin , has been living since Monday evening .
The suite , in which the Canadian singer lives , costs exactly as much in the day , as her Mama Ewa earns half a year .
If not .
They say : `` my Vikings would have to sit in the tenth class of the high school . ''
`` I give her a dream . ''
School duty ?
Who is it ?
The fans do not .
Even Bieber himself does not .
It has already done so .
For advertising in the break of the supermarket , he received three million , a two-year deal with an anti-pick company , a lot of dollars , many dollars in the Bieber account .
And for every doll , which looks like him and goes over the box , Bieber also gets .
When Justin Bieber drinks a coffee , you wonder at the window .
He is said to have exploited more than 100 million .
Some say that the hype is going too far .
Others stress that Bieber is finally in the US and the UK with his new single `` What do you mean ? '' in place 1 .
Bieber himself , whose fourth album is supposed to follow in November , is not interested in the many zeros .
At least he does .
Pegida poster brings the Lebanese to the idea of a potato potato idea
Potatoes or döner ?
Both - and this is the case in the potato wine developed by the Oldenburger snack owner , Hani Alhay .
Inspired by the slogan `` potato instead of Döner '' on a poster of the Pegida movement , Alhay has put potatoes and meat together on a chest .
The idea brought him to the idea of a poster at a Pegida demonstration called `` potatoes instead of döner , '' which he had accidentally seen on television .
Since then , there has been a Barbecue in his shop , which is equipped with meat and potatoes .
`` This is Multikulti for the stomach , '' says Alhay .
The idea of Lebanon now has to be registered with the Munich Patent Office .
According to the authority , it has recently been protected as a utility model .
Like a lot of meat and a lot of potatoes , Alhay does not want to betray it .
Just so much , `` It tastes even better , '' he finds .
For its customers , too , the culinary understanding of the world comes to a good start .
Metcash starts the Sustainability Campaign to Fight Aldiah Reaction
Metcash tries to protect the IGA-Filials from an Aldi march in South Australia and Western Australia .
Food wholesaler Metcash has launched a sustainability campaign to defend the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in the run-up to a 700 million invasion of the Aldi invasion .
While ALDI prepares the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year , Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the IGA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing through social media , as well as events like Adelay Show .
IGA dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as ice manufacturer Simmo from Dunsborough , who distributes samples and store owners who sell approved tickets for the South Australian football league to loyal customers .
Metcash is expected to publish further details of its defense strategy on September 29 , when the wholesale trader for food , alcohol , and equipment carries out its annual investor strategy day .
There is a great deal at stake , as South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30 % of Metcash 's IGA sales and higher profit margins as a Metcash IGA network in the eastern states .
Buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are notoriously provincial and IGA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 % in South Australia and 24 % in Western Australia , compared to about 14 % in the eastern states .
But analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe that , 12 months after the opening of its first markets , ALDI will take away around 5 % of the food market in these two countries and will take away all existing actors , but mainly independent retailers .
According to a report published this week , the analyst Tom Kierath of Morgan Stanley estimated that IGA retailers could lose 360 $ 360 billion a year , and Metcash could lose $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
This forecast is based on the assumption that ALDI will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in Wa next year and will reach a turnover of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
The loss of food and food , and the quantities of Metcash 's high fixed cost base , could cost $ 13 million in interest and tax profit , said Mr Kierath .
At the same time , Metcash is losing market shares in the eastern states , mainly ALDI and Coles , although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that IGA buyers are the most loyal .
Morgan Stanley estimates that Metcash 's sales in food and food business will fall by 3.8 % in 2016 , 4.1 % in 2017 and 2.1 % in 2018 , and will reduce the market share from 14 % in 2015 to 10.4 % by 2020 .
Last week , the leading fund manager Hamish Douglass , the founder of the Magellan Financial Group , said that Metcash is likely to disappear within a decade .
Metcash refused to respond publicly to Mr Douglass 's comments .
But it is assumed that a member of the board of Metcash contacted Mr Douglass last week .
IGA 's market share has declined from 18 % to 14 % since 2010 , and income from Metcash 's food and food trade , which provides about 1,200 IGA retailers , has fallen by 43 % since 2012 , reflecting operational debt reduction while exerting pressure on sales and margins .
The wholesaler , however , is doing and is investing more than $ 150 million to align sales prices with Coles and Woolworths in hundreds of products every week , and to improve IGA retailers in improving their stores through faster fresh food , and to provide a better choice of privateable food .
Metcash 's chief executive , Ian Morrice , says that price adjustments and retail sales programs are going to be strong , and hopes that in 2017 , the wholesaler will return to profit growth for the first time in four years .
Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by the President of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves praise rather than criticism of his behavior .
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the `` collateral damage '' in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyrgios and deserves praise rather than criticism for his own behaviour in the opinion of the President of the Australian tennis association , Steve Healy .
Kokkinakis , the youngest of the talented Duos , who is always called `` Special KS , '' was put into the spotlight by the infamous confrontation of Kyrgios with Stan Waailka at the Montreal Masters .
In a fiery qualification game in Cincinnati , Kokkinakis and his opponent , Ryan Harrison , had to be separated twice by the referee , with Harrison saying , `` Waailka would have had to beat Kyrgios , and I should beat the child . ''
While he was last seen , as he broke a tennis racquet after a collar sworn a potential US Open victory by Richard Gasquet , Kokkinakis was steadfastly defended by Healy .
The teenager is currently in Glasgow , in competition with Sam Groth around the second place behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis-Cup semi-final against the United Kingdom .
`` One thing about which I am quite concerned is the fact that , in my opinion , Thanasi has been drawn into a little in the quarrel , '' said Healy .
He broke a racquet when he lost in the US Open because of a sorcerer , but he is not the first player who broke a racket with himself , and I know Thanasi is good enough to know that he is not proud of it .
But , indeed , he has behaved extremely well in the US Open , even in the rather provocative circumstances with Harrison and so on , and I think he deserves a great deal .
He has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he has been treated too strictly .
Healy also supported the decision not to take into account Kyrgios in the important advance decision , which begins on Friday , and he describes the `` joint decision '' as the right one for all , but it assures the man of Canberra to return as a permanent part of the team .
`` Finally , we want the team to be completely focused on competition and not on all the controversies all around [ Kyrgios ] , '' said Healy .
Europe 's Refugee Crisis : Hungary declares emergency , closes the border , keeps refugees back
Hungary explains the state of emergency and closed the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and kept everyone who tried to enter the country illegally , all with the aim of stopping the influx of migrants .
Chaos ensued at the border , when hundreds of migrants came to no man 's land and Serbian officials responded with indignation .
The people who had fled from violence for an unknown time in a country along the road between the two control points in the countries and built tents and settled there .
But frustrations increased .
When a police helicopter ran over them , the migrants `` open the border ! '' and shook insults against the Hungarian riot police .
Some protest food and water returned .
Serbia 's foreign minister declared that it is `` unacceptable '' that migrants would be sent back from Hungary , while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive .
-LRB- Serbia -RRB- wants to be part of the solution , not a collateral damage .
There must be talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days , said Ivica Dacic in Prague .
The turbulence on the Hungarian-Serb border was unable to reach a common immigration policy at a controversial meeting in Brussels at a controversial meeting in Brussels .
But the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people who were seeking refuge in the uncorrupted Italy and Greece , expressing their hope that an agreement would be reached - either next month or by the end of the year - that the EU countries would absorb a further 120,000 refugees , including some of Hungary .
Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the continent 's immigration crisis .
Hungary , however , did not put its hopes in an early action from Brussels or its neighbours .
The emergency in two southern regions , which was called on Tuesday , gave authorities more powers to deal with the crisis , so that they could slow down roads and speed up asylum procedures .
Meanwhile , the Hungarian Foreign Minister , Peter Szijjarto , said that his country was also planning the construction of a barbed wire along its border with Romania in order to stop the influx of migrants through the country , after ending a fence at the Serbian border .
CBS News-correspondent Charlie D 'Agata reported that even prison inmates were deployed in the race of the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
Over the last few months , Hungary has become a major bottleneck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East , and it has become the European Union 's entry point .
However , Prime Minister Viktor Orban insisted that most of the coming economic migrants are in search of a better life , not war refugees , who are entitled to protection - a view that is very contrary to other EU countries , including Germany .
The new laws , which came into force at midnight in Hungary , are committing the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4-meter -LRB- 13 feet -RRB- the high fence that the government had to build along the southern border with Serbia , and these laws also impose higher prison sentences for convicted traffickers .
`` Due to the situation created by mass migration , the Hungarian government declares the emergency state , '' said government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs reporters in the southern town of Szeged .
We say it is very clear : Illegal crossing is a crime .
Parliament still has to agree to the use of the military , which is expected for next week , but reporters from Associated Press have already seen armed soldiers on the border with vehicles and dogs for days .
Gyorgy Bakondi , Land Security Adviser for Orban , said that authorities caught 45 people in an attempt to cross the border , 15 others had already penetrated deeper into the country .
They come about by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are being accused of committing crimes according to the new laws .
Authorities are in the process of repairing the fence quickly .
Hungarian officials also signed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning , after a van truck with barbed wire was to close the borders .
Chaos surrounded the most important border crossing near Roszke , Hungary , when the Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and put a set of people pressed to intervene there .
About 20 managed to come in , but thousands stayed outside .
Another group of migrants blocked the most important motorway link of Serbia and Hungary , and said that they would refuse food and water until they were allowed to enter Hungary .
Polls - 2016 : Hillary Clinton 's lead by Bernie Sanders in the National poll
Former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double-digit lead in the democratic race for the nomination at national level , but Senator Bernie Sanders wins her over the ground .
Clinton now has the support of 47 % of democratic voters in the pre-election period -LRB- 58 % before -RRB- , while Sanders is in second place , with 27 percent -LRB- 17 % higher -RRB- .
Vice President Joe Biden , who has not yet announced whether he is standing for the presidency , receives support of 15 % of pre-election democratic voters .
More than five months before the start of the preliminary elections , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is clear which candidates will support them .
But Clinton 's supporters are more consistent than that of the other candidates .
Since the CBS-News survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups , while Sanders made some gains .
Clinton has a large lead in women and moderates , but these advances have diminished .
Your support for men has fallen significantly , and Sanders has only five points here .
Clinton 's benefits for democratic voters under the age of 50 have evaporated , and they are now equal .
But Clinton still has a big lead with the older voters .
Last month , Clinton was a two-digit margin for the liberals , but Sanders now has a five-point lead to that group .
About half of pre-election democratic voters say that they would support Clinton if they were nominated by the party .
A quarter would support them with some reservations , and another 15 % would only support them because it is the candidate .
Six percent would not support them .
Perhaps not surprisingly , Clinton 's current supporters are particularly enthusiastic about her .
The views are more mixed with those who do not currently support Clinton - only a quarter would enthusiastically support it .
While 48 % of pre-election democratic voters say that they enthusiastically support Clinton , less Republican voters say this about their top candidate , Donald trump -LRB- 35 % -RRB- .
When Clinton 's supporters are asked in an open question about why they want it to be the candidate , the most common answer is that she has the right experience -LRB- 16 % -RRB- , followed by the view that it is time to be a woman president -LRB- 13 % -RRB- , and that she is the best candidate for the job -LRB- 10 % -RRB- .
Clinton 's supporters also mentioned her link with Bill Clinton -LRB- 9 % -RRB- .
Consent to the handling of problems and dithering is also quoted .
As the Vice-President raises a potential for the presidency , 57 % of pre-election democratic voters want to see him in the race - though a third believes that he should not do it .
When democratic voters of the preselection are asked who would be their second election for the party , Biden is at the helm .
Of Clinton 's supporters , more than half say that Biden 's second choice is far from Sanders .
If Biden decides not to stand for the nomination of the Democrats , Hillary Clinton 's lead is raised before Sanders , from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points without him in the race .
Twenty-five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chance to win the election ; however , that figure has fallen by 78 % last month .
Biden is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that regards it as the `` choice '' has risen .
Nevertheless , on the question of what is more important for a candidate , Democratic voters ask them questions about dithering .
Just as in the last month , not a single democratic candidate or potential candidate for these pre-election voters is unacceptable .
The Democratic candidates or potential candidates are producing good results for some important features of voters in the election of their party .
Majorities consider Clinton , Sanders and Biden to be honest , trustworthy and endowed with strong leadership skills .
For the three candidates , Biden ranks best with honesty , while Clinton 's strength is the leadership .
Thirty per cent of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trustworthy , double as many say it about Sanders -LRB- 15 % -RRB- , but 27 % have no opinion on it .
Democratic voters of the primaries generally see Clinton , Sanders and Biden in ideological agreement with their views .
In all these measurements , about a quarter of democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders .
As questions about Hillary Clinton 's use of a personal e-mail address and a server during his term as Secretary of State continue to be made , most pre-election Democratic voters are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not influenced their opinions .
But it is a different story in the American public as a whole .
Half of the Americans are now dissatisfied with their explanation , while only one third is satisfied .
Public opinion was divided in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
Most Americans said that the e-mail controversy did not affect their general views of Clinton , although 36 % said that their opinion had deteriorated .
It is mainly Republicans , more than six of 10 , who say that their views of Clinton have become worse .
Although Clinton is regarded as honest and trustworthy by the voters in her party , this remains a problem for them among registered voters : Only 32 % see it as honest and trustworthy , eight percent less than in last month and 15 points less since May .
62 per cent of eligible voters do not regard them as an honest and trustworthy person .
At the same time , 55 % of eligible voters also see trump as dishonest and not trustworthy .
But Clinton and trump get good marks in the hands of leadership .
Of the six candidates tested , Biden , Carson and Bush best cut honesty .
A majority looks more honest with Sanders , but as with Carson , many have no opinion of him .
The error rate for the sample of 351 Democratic voters in the pre-election period is 6 percentage points .
Ben Carson 's move to the national poll near Donald trump
Ben Carson is in the latest survey of CBS News / New York Times close to Donald trump
The two candidates now account for half of the support of the voters in the new poll , and others are losing dramatically .
Republican voters continue to support trump in a large number , with support growing by 23 % in the last CBS poll conducted before Fox News debate last month , by 27 % in the Tuesday poll .
But Carson shot in the same period from 6 % to 23 % .
The survey also showed that Carson is good at demographic groups and surpasses trump among Republican voters with higher education .
The rest of the field , with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Governor John Kasich , has been knocked down with Wisdom 's governor , Scott Walker , who has fallen deeply from 10 % support last month to now 2 % .
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush , the former governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee , and Florida-Senator Marco Rubio are at 6 % in third place .
The error margin in the sample of 376 persons of Republican voters in this latest survey is Plus or minus 6 % and was conducted in September .
The latest CNN / ORC survey released last week shows that Carson is rising in the polls - he gets 19 % support for the Republicans , behind the trump with 32 % support .
The recent survey by ABC News / Washington Post also showed trump to Carson .
With a look at a Carson who was rising last week , trump found some tips for the former neurochir , even after Carson apologized for questioning trump 's faith .
`` We need energy , '' said trump last Saturday during a campaign launch in Iowa .
Pleasant bathing temperatures : The eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees .
Even if top values are measured only in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is enough to find warm water .
A bath in the North or the Baltic Sea should be a short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
Some are no longer in the sea : There is a maximum of 18 degrees of water in the North and the Baltic Sea this week , shared by the German weather system -LRB- DWD -RRB- .
On the other hand , the Mediterranean Sea continues to offer bathing temperatures : In the east there is even up to 29 degrees .
In the Adriatic Sea there are 25 degrees in France , 23 degrees in France .
The Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
Five members of the Brotherhood with the death of a barge college novice
Almost two years after a student died in a student relationship in Pocono Mountains , Pennsylvania , a student died , killing five people .
Members of the New York Baruch College Pi-Delta-Pie Brotherhood attacked Chun `` Michael '' Deng brutally during an introductory session in September 2013 , and delayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death , the police reported .
Officials said that he had been burdened with a 30-pin bag filled with sand , and had been attacked repeatedly , while he tried to reach an end over a frozen field .
Mr. Deng eventually complained about headaches , then he fell unconscious .
The members of the Pi-delta Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 , after Deng became powerless and supposedly waited for an hour before bringing him to a hospital , so the police .
However , they had the time to change Deng 's clothing , to goose his symptoms and Andy Meng , to contact the national president of the Brotherhood to seek advice , said Police Chief Chris Wagner at a press conference .
`` At this point , the members began to hide Utensilien and put the good of the Brotherhood on the welfare of Michael Deng in principle , '' said Polisignef Wagner .
He could not be resurrected , and he died next morning at his injuries .
After an autopsy report , Deng was repeatedly dealt injuries to head , hull , and thighs with blunt force .
`` Too many families have been destroyed by the harassment of the Brotherhood . '' at least a student has died every year since 1970 , said Douglas Fierberg , a lawyer who represents the Dengs family , in a statement .
Disputes and their members must be held to account , and this step by authorities is very important .
A County Grand jury of Monroe recommended a charge for the first five members for Mordes third grade .
Thirty-two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Meng , are also charged with charges of harassment and the formation of a criminal association .
`` We do n't just want to hold the people responsible , but if there is an organisation which , officially or unofficially , has sanctioned this , we will also hold them accountable , '' said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday .
The Baruch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the national Brotherhood has revoked its membership of the group of places .
This will happen when the Fed increases interest rates
There is a rise in interest rates , and the house will collapse , bond yields will rise , and the economy will slide into recession .
We know that .
What we do not know is how long it will take and how long it will last .
In particular , the history of the economy offers little guidance on expiry .
A recession came within just 11 months after the first interest-rate hike and lasted 86 months .
The Federal Reserve 's aggressiveness in raising interest rates is often , if not always , a factor in how the economy and financial assets respond .
That is why representatives of the US central bank have stressed so strongly that investors should not focus on when they begin to raise interest rates , but rather the period required for normalisation .
Indeed , several variables play a role .
In the end , however , market participants may find that all the excitement has been exaggerated because of an interest-rate hike .
`` The first increase in the Fed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of cheap money , '' said Julian Jessop , Chief Economist at Capital Economics , in a communication to customers .
By contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US rates to normal heights , but still to low levels to lead to the seismic shock that many seem to fear .
However , this does not mean that there will be no impact .
Here is a look based on historical trends , on how some parts of the economy could respond :
As the market has seen last month , the removal of interest rates can make things volatile for a while .
As soon as the increase arrives , the influence is not so dramatic .
`` There is apparently a tendency that wealth earnings will be discouraged 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which may again reflect the delay in monetary policy , '' German bank analysts said in a recent study of what happens after the Fed raised interest rates .
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on stocks tends to occur later on , and the return begins to decline .
Recessions are a fact of economic life , but rate hikes often promote them .
In the current case , the Fed is faced with some conditions that did not exist before and could accelerate a recession .
What is most remarkable is that gross domestic product will be close to its lowest point if the Fed is to increase interest .
According to Deutsche Bank , for the 118 interest rates since 1950 , nominal GDP stood below 4.5 % since 1950 .
Although the second quarter of 2015 stood at 3.6 % , few expect that this will continue , and will expect only 1.5 % for the third quarter , according to the Atlanta Fed .
Raising rates in such a fragile economic setting could be risky , raising the question , `` whether it is different this time , '' said Deutsche Bank .
Market participants have caught up on a price increase in the Fed all year round , and all eyes were addressed to the Federal Open Market Committee 's meeting this week , which ends on Thursday .
While many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC could approve an increase in this meeting , futures trading only provides a chance of 25 % .
`` In our study , all the boom cycles of 1950 have taken place in a super cycle , with increasing momentum in GDP , and the report is very soon in the shadows after the start of the recovery . ''
By contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed period .
The current cycle is by far the longest that the Fed has been waiting for since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this is now 74 months .
The fixed income was also volatile , as the market anticipates an increase in interest , and the pattern is quite similar to that of the capital market .
The main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than in stocks when they change their strategic course .
On bonds , yields seem to change direction as soon as the first increase / reduction in the cycle occurs .
At the end of the boom cycle , bond yields fall immediately , said Deutsche Bank .
Charles Schwab 's strategists believe that the rise in interest rates will lead to a closer return of returns between longer and shorter bonds , leading to a slowdown in the curve .
High-income bonds often yield better returns in such a climate , although `` we are still careful to expect higher returns , '' said Kathy Jones , fixed income analyst in Schwab , in an analysis .
Interestingly , Jones says that the markets have already adapted to Fed strategy expectations .
`` In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of stricter monetary policy , '' she wrote .
Short-term interest rates have increased , the earnings curve is flat , credit margins have expanded , and volatility has risen - all features of the market when the Fed strengthens its strategy .
On the whole , companies that manage the larger part of their business in the US will benefit from rising interest rates and make local products more attractive .
Multinationals with high debt will be worse off , as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market , as well as financing their debts .
`` History shows that '' quality `` shares tend to respond very positively to three months after an initial rate hike , '' said Goldman Sachs 's analysts in a report to customers .
Companies with a strong balance sheet have surpassed 5 percentage points on average after each of the rates raised in 1994 , 1999 , and 2004 .
Companies with high capital returns as well as low volatility in their shares also transferred their counterparts with low quality at an average level of 4 -LRB- percentage points -RRB- and 3 -LRB- percentage points -RRB- .
Debt is a major problem .
Companies with a large share of flexible interest rates will lose the most , said Goldman .
Outside pure stock games , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar .
Savers could see gains from higher returns , even if experts disagree on how fast it will be .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says Parliament member Andrew Bingham
The Conservative Member of Parliament criticised the station because of its `` confusion ''
He argues that he is increasingly different from commercial rivals .
He also aimed at the BBC Music Awards and said that they imitated only The Brits
Parliamentary colleague Damien Collins attacked The Voice and said that this was not very original .
BBC Radio 3 `` transforms itself '' to Classic FM , claims a leading Member of Parliament and increases new pressure on the channel to prove that he is doing something that private broadcasters do not do .
The Conservative Member , Andrew Bingham , also said to the BBC Bossen that the public radio station was `` wrong '' and increasingly different from its commercial competitors .
`` Radio 3 seems - I use the word '' `` does not like - but it seems to turn into classic FM , '' he said .
He also aimed at the BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
The BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be The Brits only under a different name .
So if you try to do something else , these are two spontaneous examples in which you actually imitate what is already on the market , said Mr Bingham .
BBC Director-General pointed out the accusations and argued that BBC Radio 3 is far from its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and public awareness .
What I learn from Radio 3 , I will not learn differently from classical music .
And there is a commitment to live music and music that is truly unsurpassed .
`` And the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and to order new works , I really think it is important , '' he said .
At the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Davey argued that hard work needed to be done to engage the audience than it did in the past , because the British were less aware of classical music .
Radio 3 , however , was not the only element of BBC production , which , during the hearing in the Committee on Culture , Media and Sport , came under fire to stand up to commercial rivals .
The Tory MEP , Damien Collins , attacked The Voice - the BBC 's musical talent show , which was bought by the Dutch producer Talpa Media for an estimated cost of £ 22 million .
Do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly markant ?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - with Paloma Faith and Boy George as a judge - was produced in a special BBC way .
He added that he would like to see the company `` find a hit from our own barn '' when it started the next time an entertainment series .
However , he refused to exclude the order from other ranks of The Voice in the future , or to spend money on charges for other entertainment formats .
Internet sales increased in August and the Black Friday can be responsible for this .
In the first three months of 2015 , there was 7 % increase in online sales .
Last month , there was the lowest result since the beginning of the records in 2000
Online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping .
Experts believe that , in November , the Black Friday slowed spending .
For over a decade , virtual shopping has drilled , and many of Britain 's main shopping streets have turned into ghost cities .
But experts say that there are now signs that online sales stagnate after new figures showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
The total expenditure for August represented the lowest increase in growth since the start of the records in 2000 , with only five percent of growth compared to the previous year .
Experts say that there are signs that online sales stagnate after new figures only showed seven percent of growth in the first three months of 2015 .
`` If you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , then this has developed over time , '' said Andy Mulcahy , editor of the IMRG sales index of the Guardian .
He explained that online sales increased three years ago , when buyers began to make purchases with their mobile phones .
It meant that more people were able to buy online and that people were able to do so in different environments , for example at home on the sofa .
But now that is moving forward , and we may see that growth will be reduced .
The black Frin phenomenon , imported from America , is quoted as a reason for the declining sales .
Experts believe that buyers hold their purchases before this event , which takes place last Friday in November .
Last year , five times the average number of buyers started to use their computers to make a bargain , and some vendor sites crashed .
Experts believe that Black Friday , at which the buyers fought for bargains , could prevent buyers from making purchases .
A study by the British Retail Consortium found that 5 £ editions were spent on more than 1 £ online .
For some products such as televisions and washing machines , more than one third of purchases are now carried out via web shops .
At the same time , more than one quarter of people are buying clothes and shoes online instead of the fashion chains in the inner cities .
Muslims are buried in Mecca with the crane accident - Bin Laden 's family is sanctioned .
The corpses of 29 dead are driven by Muslims at the first ceremonies in Mecca by the streets in Mecca
Saudi Arabia sets the load on the collapse of part of the huge Saudi binary group
The Ministry of Health said that , in addition , a total of 394 people were injured after the crane crashed
Hundreds of Muslims gathered together when 29 of the victims were taken by the streets to bury those who were killed when a crane crashed on Mekka 's big lake .
Mourners , largely dressed in white , the track , to pay their respect when the first of the dead entered their last journey to the Al Moung cemetery .
The funeral procession passed at the Holy Site , where only a few days before a building crane crashed through the ceiling of the mosque and then to the people who prayed .
The bodies were released for the funeral when the Saudi king imposed a sanction on the construction of the family Bin Laden because of the disaster , which also left 394 .
The bodies of 29 people who were killed when a crane crashed through the Great Central moschee Mekkas were carried by the streets .
Among the dead was Qasim Akram from Bolton , Greater Manchester , the father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane helped .
Mr Akram was with his parents before the start of the annual Haddsch in the Great Mosque .
Saudi officials have already agreed that the Haddsch will continue in Mecca with thousands of people who will continue to come to the city .
Today , King Salman said that the Bin-Ladus group should not have stopped the arm of the crane when it was not used .
An Arab version of the decree published by the State Saudi Press Agency said that the Bin-Laden group was responsible for the collapse .
The English-speaking service of the news agency did not report this detail , but said that the company 's leadership was banned abroad .
At the beginning of this week , Salman pledged to reveal what caused the fall of the crane , which crashed into a courtyard of the large lake , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered before the Haddsch , which will take place later this month .
The Bin-Lady group has not issued any statements about the collapse of de cranes , and its representatives were not available for an opinion .
The Royal Decree also passed the group because of the lack of current security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteorologists .
Dozens of cranes surround Mekka 's large lake as part of the massive building project led by the Bin-Laden group .
The family Bin Laden has been associated with the ruling family of Saudi Arabia for decades , and has taken on larger construction projects .
The late leader of Al Qaeda , Osama bin Laden , was a renegade son who was expropriated by the family in the 1990 s .
The crash of the crane came in the midst of strong winds and rain , just a few days before the arrival of millions of people in the Kingdom for the pilgrimage that is needed at least once in the life of every healthy Muslim .
Officials said that 158 people remain in the hospital .
Government officials ordered that 1 million Rial -LRB- £ 174,000 -RRB- would be paid to the relatives of those killed and that the same amount was permanently injured .
Other injuries receive half that amount .
B & Q Boss says that the time of cheap Eastern European craftsmen is over
Britain is increasingly employing craftsmen , says Veronique Laury
The number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe has risen
This leads to the opening of 200 other screwfix shops aimed at craftsmen
At the same time , Kingfisher will close 60 B & Q outlets across the country .
Rupert Steiner , City Chief correspondent of the Daily Mail
It is claimed that Britons put their hammers and brushes in favour of the use of qualified Eastern craftsmen who are carrying out the work in their homes .
If you can deal with a hammer or a brush for removing walls , today you seem to be part of a minority .
Because Britons increasingly employ craftsmen to carry out home jobs in their homes , that is the leader of the company behind B & Q.
Véronique Laury , the new manager of Kingfisher , who owns the Bausch chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe who offer services at low prices is now obsolete .
Therefore , Kingfisher plans to open 200 further Screwfix shops that are directed to craftsmen and 60 points of sale of B & Q .
Mrs Laury said that she wanted to employ more women in B & C shops , because eight out of ten purchase decisions in the shop are made by women .
At the moment the men outweigh the men .
She said that it is necessary to face up to the growing demographic trends that have more female single households that make more renovation than in the past .
Mrs Laury said : It still works a majority of men in our stores .
We need to shift this further towards a balance .
In principle , half of our clients consist of women with 80 % of the decisions on the purchase of articles by women .
Women play a major role in the decision-making process .
Mrs Laury , who is one of only five women at the top of a British company listed in the FTSE100 index , has also planned her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in management positions .
Kingfisher is almost the only company that has occupied exactly 50 % of the team with women , including its management and CFO .
Mrs Laury said : This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here .
It was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board .
Kingfisher reported a decrease in the half-year profit and the turnover after the group held the cost of closing the shops .
Because of the trends , Kingfisher , the Screwfix and B & Q , will open 200 new branches .
Officials of Aich / DOB because of infidelity in court
At the National Court of Klagenfurt , on Wednesday , two officials of the Austrian volleyball vice champion , Aich / DOB , have had to be responsible for infidelity and return education .
The accused were not guilty .
One of them had also been accused of official abuse .
He was legally acquitted of this accusation in May .
The current process has been postponed .
According to the Supreme Prosecutor , Robert Riffel , the preliminary investigation pointed out that the accused used funds for private purposes in the years 2006 to 2011 , on which they were allowed to engage in their functions .
The damage is estimated at around 400,000 euros .
Sports officials are also charged with financial penalties .
This is a fact left by the leader of the Schöffensenate , Judge Michaela Sanin .
It is to be negotiated at a later date .
To the end of the infidelity , the defense was that the club did not create an asset part at any time .
Sports officials would only have charged the expenses and the sports club for which they worked from 1982 to 2011 , and in which they had invested a lot of time and money , were accounting for a total of 600,000 schillings -LRB- EUR 44,000 -RRB- in 2001 .
`` We were in front of the situation : Continue or lock the club , '' said one of the defendants , in the bread profession of the financial office .
With his colleagues and colleagues , he decided to take over this task .
With all the risks .
`` We have made money , we have been doing our life insurance for safety at the bank , '' he said in the course of acceptance .
The association has been agreed : You can manage the money freely , no debt can be made .
Furthermore , with the appropriate financial success , the payment of the conversion expenses has been decided retroactively until 1991 .
As a result , some of the conversion expenses have been paid out only years later , namely from 2003 , when a plus had been on the account .
Therefore , the former Obmann explained what was happening .
The accounts and savings books managed the two defendants together , said the second defendant .
Why payouts were not disclosed in detail , the judge asked .
The association was not interested in the detail of the financial management , which was only important for the freedom of debt , that is , the answer .
When , in 2011 , an investigation into official abuse began , a sum of 120,000 euros was transferred to the association account .
These were setbacks , declared the accused .
This securities account went on the name of the second accused and was not known to the club .
`` Why ? '' the judge wanted to know .
The survey had no response to this for a long time .
Then he said that he believed that this was the best for the club .
If something had happened , no one would have known about this money , that the prosecutor was in the room .
The official should have been informed , and the official did so .
This bank transfer was formulated as a `` damage refund . ''
Why did the judge and the public prosecutor want to know ?
The first person said that he did not agree with this phrase because the association had never been damaged .
But what should I do when the lawyer says : `` You are all from the tailor . ''
`` I am a legal representative ? '' he asked .
Furthermore , the owner said that he had never received a cent salary , he only charged mileage and diets .
On diets he charged € 1,000 a month to the association , but the actual expenditure was much higher , he added .
Exact documents for the early years have not been able to show the accused .
They have not been preserved after an operating check in which everything has been judged correctly , they said .
The second defendant also referred to mileage .
All houses are located in bar , and he has had to travel to Bleiburg from his place of residence , he said in his statement .
The main negotiation will continue on 23 September with the questioning of witnesses .
Hewlett-Packard has another 30,000 jobs .
In addition to the reduction in the number of employees that have been running for three years , the computer giant will reduce further jobs in the division of the company .
The availability of the US computer giant Hewlett-Packard -LRB- HP -RRB- does not end .
Within the framework of its restructuring , the US technology group is planning a reduction of 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate business .
This is to reduce the cost of $ 2.7 billion -LRB- EUR 2.4 billion -RRB- , which the company shared on Tuesday .
The move will lead to a special burden of around $ 2.7 billion , which will result from the fourth quarter .
The reduction of 55,000 jobs has not yet been completed for three years .
At the end of the financial year 2013 / 14 , HP still employed some 302,000 people .
For example , the Hewlett-Packard share was 2.3 % .
The company with printers from the Californian Palo Alto is currently moving on : This is how the computer and printing business is to be bundled in a new society this year - separately from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies and other services .
Both business parts are to be listed on the stock exchange .
A newly disappointing PC paragraph , as well as a weaker demand from corporate customers in accordance with its services , put the world 's second largest PC manufacturer to Lenovo .
In the third quarter at the end of July , PC and printer sales fell by 11.5 percent .
Sales fell by 8 percent to $ 25.4 billion .
As a result , the proceeds returned to 15 quarters in 16 quarters .
HP responds to the change in the industry by means of a split and a massive range of positions .
The 76 year-old company under the leadership of Meg Whitman only reacted late to the fact that customers are buying smartphones and tablets rather than buying traditional computers and doing more and more business online .
Whitman 's restructuring plans account for a reduction of some 55,000 jobs .

Röszke : Violence of the Serbian Hungarian border
The Hungarian police used several hundred refugees at the Serbian border at the Serbian border .
Euronews-correspondent Dániel Bozsik has witnessed the violence at the border control point .
He reported by telephone :
A group of refugees broke the border .
Behind this , a police line had been formed , and a water cannon was ready behind the police .
40 to 50 refugees began to throw stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials .
The officials initially replaced pepper spray continuously .
After that , the police used tear gas .
A lot of tear gas has been stolen in the direction of the refugees .
That is how the group was dissolved .
The refugees have now withdrawn something .
A pregnant and apparently injured woman was removed from the zone .
Children who had inhaled the tear gas cried .
Other refugees died in themselves and suffered from breathing .
The press experts from the Serbian police have also suffered injuries through the use of tear gas and pepper spray .
Time for the Fed 's Interest Rates
The world is watching when the Fed comes together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to take the important decision to decide whether or not to raise interest rates for the first time in almost a decade .
A survey of 80 economists questioned by Reuters found that a little more than half , which was believed last week that the Fed would do this , now thinks that the Fed will remain a little longer and keep interest rates at the current rate of 0 - 0.25 % .
It is a historic event because it is seven years since the Fed put interest rates to zero .
`` For the first time , we are approaching a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of normalization of interest rates , '' said Angel Ubide , senior employee at Peterson Institute for International Economics .
The US economy is on a relatively good level of output , trillions of dollars added to the balance sheet and only generate low inflation .
But the Fed can not ignore the less rosy outlook of global relations .
It has warned markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs suggest that the chances of such a move are good .
The decision is to be announced at 8 o 'clock CET on Thursday .
Death Crimes at Delta State University have left relief letters
After killing and killing his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he bleed and killed his colleague later this day - Shannon Lamb wrote a note to say that he `` feels sorry '' at the first murder , `` he could do it , '' authorities announced on Tuesday .
The police in Gautier , Mississippi , said that lamb , lecturer for geography and social education at the Delta State University , called the emergency number to 10 : 00 on Monday morning
And he said that he had shot on someone and killed someone .
Lamb told the staff of the emergency centre that the police had to send police to his home .
He said , `` I shot my wife yesterday evening , '' and he also mentioned that a `` sweet dog '' is in the house , but `` no one will disturb , '' but will probably be excited .
The police asked the caller on his behalf , but he did not give it .
Lamb gave no explanation for his shots .
When police entered the scene , they found the body of Amy Prentiss , 41 , and a handwritten note of lamb , 45 , which said : I am so sorry , I wanted to undo it .
I loved Amy , and she is the only woman who ever loved me .
After writing the note , Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed Ethan Schmidt , a professor of history , before taking his own life on Monday evening when police officers surrounded him .
University President William LaForge said that he did not know about a conflict between lamb and Schmidt , but `` of course , there was something in Mr Lambs . ''
Despite reports on Monday , the Lamb allegedly believed that Prentiss also had a relationship with Schmidt , said on Tuesday that there was `` no information , no evidence '' to a `` triangle relationship . ''
Prentiss was described by Shawn O 'Steen , who said that she was married about seven years ago as a `` good man . ''
The two were divorced 15 years ago , but remained friends .
O 'Steen said that he and Prentiss would have a daughter who is 19 , and they were `` destroyed by the ground . ''
He said that Prentiss was her daughter , `` absolutely best friends . ''
Prentiss worked online at home , according to Linsday Knowles , who was identified as a close friend of Prentiss by the Sun Herald .
Knowles said that Prentiss , who had a dog named lightning , had met with lamb for about three years .
`` You wanted to help other people , '' said Knowles
The police said , lamb called relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them that `` he is not going to prison . ''
When policemen took him on Highway 1 near Greenville later this night , lamb drove his car , fled to foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot .
Lamb received a doctoral degree from Delta State University in the spring of 2015 , how his life is on the university 's website .
Stars that have Lost their Messenger
The actor -LRB- left -RRB- , in image with his son Redmond -LRB- right -RRB- , had some stressful years .
In 2001 , he fought against leukaemia , and in 2009 he lost his long-time partner , Farrah Fawcett , because of cancer .
The actor also claims to fight with drugs , and in 2008 he was sentenced for drug possession .
All this certainly calls for its tribute .
Eurowings : Lufthansa builds the Group
Lufthansa is planning a major corporate restructuring .
The Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros a year with a better organisation .
150 of the world 's roughly 1,000 executives will cost the company 's job .
There are , however , new negotiations with the pilot trade .
Lufthansa builds its corporate structure and evaluates the low-cost companies of Eurowings .
The goal of the realignment was a earnings contribution of approximately EUR 500 million a year from cost and solution synergies , divided by the airline on Wednesday .
Among other things , in future , Lufthansa will no longer have a board of directors for the passenger business .
The low-cost airline of Eurowings should be developed as independently as possible .
In the Management Board , Mr. Carsten Spohr will be responsible for Eurowings in the future .
With the new setting , Spohr underlines the importance of Eurowings , with which the Group intends to compete against Ryanair and Easyjet in the future .
Until now , the organisation of the 120 000 employees was complex .
The airlines operated under the umbrella of the Passage Airline Group , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of EUR 30 billion .
New negotiations with the pilots
In the collective bargaining dispute with the pilot association Cockpit -LRB- VC -RRB- , the negotiations shall be resumed on this Thursday after the judicial strike .
That was what the trade union shared .
The subject of the discussions is to be the retirement scheme for pilots .
In a year with a projected record result , the cockpit wants to achieve sustainable results as soon as possible .
The conflict between the trade union and airline has led to various strikes in recent months .
In addition to the transitional provision of the pilots , the background is the `` Wings '' saving concept .
In the fight against competitors , Lufthansa expects to draw up routes to the Group 's own line of low-cost Eurowings .
Under the title `` Morgenzug to the South '' are paintings by Leena Krüger in the artist 's house .
The Finnin , which has long been based in Göttingen , has put together a selection of capricious works in the White Hall , which encourage its viewers to go on journey .
Luke Shaw of Manchester United can not play for months because of double fracture
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg at the Champions League defeat of Manchester at PSV Eindhoven .
Louis van Gaal does not hope that Shaw can play again this season for at least six months .
The violation was caused by a ruthless attack by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute , after the 20-year-old Shaw in the PSV area .
He was treated for nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before he was brought to the hospital .
Van Gaal said : `` He has a double leg and lies in the hospital . ''
It will be moved tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operates in Manchester .
It is terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester United with 18 , it is very hard and then fantastic , and then that happens .
In the changing cabin he had an oxygen mask .
He cried .
I am not a doctor , but if you have a double fracture , it takes six months , and it will not occur in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Moreno seemed happy to escape a red card and the imposition of an Elfmeter .
Nicola Rizzoli , the referee , has not punished the Mexicans .
Van Gaal suspected that the Italian referee was wrong .
You can judge for yourself when I say that an Elfmeter and a red card were due .
It was a very serious attack with both legs .
A tweet on Shaws 's account was : `` I thank you all for your messages , '' words can not describe how I broke , my way to recovery begins now , I return more again .
Manchester United suffered the loss of Luke Shaw in the defeat of the PSV .
With the European Championship in France , the England defender has an additional incentive to recover by the end of June .
Phillip Cocu , the PSV trainer , said : `` It is a very serious injury . ''
When a player leaves the place with this kind of injury , everyone is very sad about it .
It is never the intention of our players to injure an opponent .
Moreno suffered a stroke when Mexico played against Van Gaals Holland Team at the 2014 World Cup .
`` He is very difficult because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and when you hear that it is a very serious injury , it is not good , '' said Cocu .
For me , it was not possible to see the moment .
The only thing I could see was the ball that was in a different direction , so that it looked as if he touched [ Moreno ] , but I could not see the attack on Luke .
In the conversation with SBS6 , Moreno said : I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be .
I feel very sorry , and I am so sorry .
The PSV player , Andrés Guardado , was also brought to the hospital - after a fan game by Chris Smalling .
Surely David Cameron knows The Lorax better ?
It 's a thing that all parents will soon learn : If your child loves a book , it will not take a long time until you know it almost always .
Unless , perhaps , you are David Cameron .
When he was asked by a provider of childcare systems to name his favorite children 's book , the Prime Minister for The Lorax chose The Lorax , which was published in 1971 by Dr. Seuss .
It was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the website of the company Supercamps , and continues : `` fun , moving , creative , and with a powerful message , it 's a book that I love to read to my children , because it always seems to be a picture or a message that we have missed so far . ''
Everything is beautiful and good , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron supposedly describes the action of the book , instead re-gives a summary of the 2012 film version of 2012 , which added new characters and details in order to extend the rather short original text .
If this were not suspicious enough , the text presented by Cameron reads partly like the summary of the Lorax film , which is presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and thus begins : `` In the walled city of Thought Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy called Ted , the heart of Audrey , hopes to win the girl of his dreams . ''
Although he admits to be a pragmatic father , Cameron seems unlikely to be so little familiar with the action of the book .
Most likely , such a relatively low PR task has been delegated to a helper who has not read The Lorax 20 times in a row .
A Downing-stream speaker said that the text was likely to have come from Cameron 's electoral office .
SuperCamps confirmed that the text of Cameron 's staff was delivered , but did not have any other immediate comments .
Adam Lyth was clearly threatened by the exclusion of England 's team , but it is still hard
Coming to Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if you see the Kader , who has chosen England for the tour , a repeat of the 3-0 test victory does not stand on my card .
I would not rule out a upward victory .
Alastair Cook 's side may be less experienced than it was three years ago , but there are good spider players in the battle list , and the Community spirit is strong ; they will not bear any 2012 scars , only a youthful positive attitude .
With the ball , Moeen Ali as a spindle and Adil Rashid , even if it is an unknown size at test level , is an option for the attack .
Note : Adam Lyth leaves from the England test loader and is replaced by Alex Hales .
The decision to leave Adam Lyth is , of course , difficult to me than his chief trainer in Yorkshire .
In his seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cricket players are aligned to results .
There were no question marks for Joe root , for example , and that led to the nomination because - as I said earlier - players are their own best choice .
Long ago , we would have prolonged the course of Lyth , but he had control of his own destiny .
If he hopefully shoots more purchases for Yorkshire , there will be another chance .
The England trainer Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude , even if he did not make such good performances , and that does not surprise me ; he is , above all , a team man .
The question of how much time has a test bell to set its mark is difficult .
Lyth got seven chances - as Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton got nine .
Only Compton got the chance to play home and forward .
The only charge that can be raised was that England first started Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean - when Lyth was at its highest - but this lost opportunity is now in the past .
Alex Hales comes in and he is a drummer and I love it .
He is an X-Faktor cricket player , which we saw in Yorkshire early in this season when he scored 236 against us on a Trent Bridge , which hit us very much .
He must have at least the same chances as he received before him , but this depends , of course , on the team position in the United Arab Emirates .
The idea of leaving Moeen in addition to Cook , which would provide an extra spindle and get four Quicks , appeared , and I have nothing against it .
I do not see why a drummer can not beat there , and this link has already shown that it is a vicious circle of cricket players .
Moeen may not do his job for his County Worcestershire , but he is a number 3 for her , and there is no big difference .
My former team mate , Justin Langer , played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he appeared in 2001 .
He has done three hundred runs immediately and did not look back .
Zafar Ansari comes to the Kader as a backup-spinner , and in my limited dealings with him he impressed me as a young man .
People may see his statistics - average 31 with the racquet and 35 with the ball - and think it is a pin , but there are no large numbers of backup spins who collect their hands and the trainers have decided for youth .
He will learn a lot on this tour .
Apart from the team , England has made some clever additions to the trainer .
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene , the Batsman from Sri Lanka as a consultant for test games , could be a masterpiece .
He is one of the sunniest guys of the game , who will bring a wealth of experience as he played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Collingwood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful use in the setup .
I always felt that he was created for international cricket competition , as a player or as a coach , and like Mahela he has insights that we can profit from .
Sometimes new voices can get fresh wind in the changing cabin , even if the news is in line with what has previously been said .
Collys 's team mate at Durham , Ben Stokes , is not used at the One-Dayers , Root received a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with my part .
Some will not agree , but coaches and team leaders do not determine the timetable .
And you must remember that , as with the players , their jobs depend on the results .
Such decisions are not taken lightly .
The Brexite warehouse -LRB- Brexit = exit of the UK from the EU -RRB- could be won by an allowance if the economy is in a slowdown by 2017 .
David Cameron 's failure to pursue a renegotiation strategy in order to keep Britain in the EU will get into trouble every day , even without the choice of the genius Jeremy `` Is it yes or no ? '' Corbyn is the leader of Labour or TUC , which is strongly stifling itself because of Europe on Tuesday .
Foreigners also have their Corbyns and Nigel Farages .
A European diplomat said recently that some Member States are so deeply involved in various crises , such as the EU , and that it is not always their own fault , Britain 's own agenda , with divided concessions and disruptive treaty changes that they mostly do not want .
In Brighton , the TUC decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it if it jeopardises social protection .
We could also call it Dave and Georges Selfie-Agenda .
Prime Minister and Finance Ministers are climbing at summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photograph of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say that they gain allies for reform .
It is always about me .
My European friend , who would like to see an outside Britain inside the EU tent , `` Do not call us with France alone , '' says Berlin - and suggests that more and more short-sighted ministers and officials in some capitals have come to the point where they do not know whether we stay or go .
Germany 's cautious German chancellor , Angela Merkel , is an ally , but it has been in power for 10 years , and wants to leave office before it looks bad for them , as happened to the excessively long old people like Thatcher -LRB- 11 years -RRB- , Mitterrand -LRB- 14 -RRB- and Kohl -LRB- 16 -RRB- .
France 's François Hollande looks at his re-election or replacement in 2017 .
It is also a diminishing force .
Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government , Spain left .
It is difficult to imagine that they will pull out a leg to help the Selfi British , whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland 's exit from the UK - something that they do not want , because most similar separatist tendencies have similar separatist tendencies .
As a result , some such ministers may even deliberately plan unhelpful comments , entirely in SNP style , while Britain 's referendum campaign to speed up the Brexite process is my friend .
`` The renegotiation was a default '' and `` Britain has won nothing of value from the renegotiation . ''
Europeans know how predatory Fleet Street can be at their expense , and which EU skeptics is the oligarchy of the press , as it was during the 1975 Tony Benn 's referendum , which supported our entry into 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
You can not remember Boris Johnson , the Nobel opportunist , who made a name as an `` EU-Gerade-Banans '' Brussels correspondent in the early 90 years .
In all his veracity , Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were .
This was the subject of the medley held by tax lords , phone burgers , and the pseudo non-Indians , who have most of our big newspapers .
In fact , Tony Blair was similar to her , but found that , when you sit with a hot gorilla in a cage , you better distribute bananas in order to distract him , rather than becoming a lunch or dinner .
Indeed , Miliband was more Blairians than Blair himself when he opposed Cameron 's referendum to referendum , because Blair had adopted the principle of the unadopted EU Constitution , which was rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened him a back door .
The press has never lost it .
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn , who gave me a friendly claps on me in Westminster on Monday - I said to him that he no longer need time to waste me - seems to risk repeating Neil Kinnocks boycott Murdoch Strategy of the 80 years , a mistake then and today .
It may take , but it must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Marr , whose BBC-Sofa left on Sunday .
Corbyns 's official position on Europe is - I press it friendly - in development .
He says that we should stay in a reformed EU .
Well , most of the people outside of Ukip 's traditional tendency towards blacks and the wilful slaughter of Torys ' Klein-Engcountry-ism ' is likely to be able to say `` yes . ''
It is what Hilary `` One Benn , but not a Bennite '' Benn said on radio this week , when the pathfinder struggled to admit that Corbyn 's appointment of the provocative John McDonnell was a bad idea .
It reminded me of the 1970s , when his old father worked on television to be loyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hilary 's struggle was even more attractive .
But struggling to remain `` under all circumstances - Benns '' was not what McDonnell said , nor was what JC told to his supporters and MEPs after all reports at their meeting session on Monday night .
What always wants to convey Corbyn 's fateful bottom-up image - remember that he even touched me - night discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and , above all , in the strudel of the social media , a breeding ground of paranoia and betrayal .
It is right that Cameron does not have a free map for Europe that allows him to keep Labour 's support in the referendum campaign for granted , as McDonnell has said .
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so .
But McDonnell and Corbyn 's basic ambiguity about EU membership - in line with their Benned siege economy , their anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a question of esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents , for whom the narcissism of small difference is a central principle of dogmatic disputes .
As with his ambiguity about NATO , Tom Watson believes that JC does not start a campaign to leave - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to find , in particular , a sense for their superiors at home .
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspicious voters - to make concessions to the British if everything can be pointless ?
The US is already quite disappointed with the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya , and Syria , even with a reduction in the cost of the Tor government in power , which I was reminded of something that was called the British flu Security Forum on Monday .
Experts criticise the report by Public Health England on e-cigarettes
Claims by a state-sponsored agency that e-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking was created from a meeting of 12 people , partly with links to the tobacco industry , said researchers .
Experts who write in the British Medical Journal -LRB- BMJ -RRB- joined Lancet by criticising the evidence used by Public Health England -LRB- PHE -RRB- in her report on e-cigarettes .
PHE published the `` Policy Report '' last month and describes it as a `` comprehensive review of evidence . ''
However , some researchers have questioned the resilience of the data and pointed to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry .
An article in the medical journal Lancet last month attacked the `` extraordinarily windy basis '' on which PHE established its most important conclusion .
Two more researchers write to BMJ and asked whether `` to build on stone or sand . ''
Martin McKee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Capewell , Professor of Clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool , said : `` A basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of effectiveness . ''
They said that the public expected that PHE 's claim that `` the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are 95 % less harmful than smoking '' are based on a detailed review of evidence and modeling .
In fact , this statement comes from a single meeting of 12 people who were convened to develop a model for a multiple criterion decision analysis -LRB- Multi-Ccriterion Decision Analysis - MCDA -RRB- to produce their opinions about the damage of different nicotine products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summarised in a research report .
McKee and Capewell said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health , whose Managing Director should have received money from British American Tobacco -LRB- BAT -RRB- for an independent study .
He also signed the references of TAOs to public health in a sustainability report , they said .
One of the 12 participants in the meeting declared that they would be given funding from an e-cigarette manufacturer , but they did not add the funding that he is supposed to have received from the tobacco company Philip Morris International after reports .
The reasons for the selection of the members of the Board are not supplied , but these include several known E-cigarette champions , some of which also provide industry financing in the paper .
Some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know-how in tobacco control .
At the meeting , we also participated in the tobacco management of PHE .
The group `` recognizes significantly '' that there is a lack of `` hard evidence for the damage of most products with most criteria , '' McKee and Capewell wrote .
However , none of these links or restrictions are discussed in the PHE report .
McKee and Capewell said that PHE 's claims that `` there is no evidence that e-cigarettes are as a way of smoking children or non-smokers '' were premature .
Prof Kevin Fenton , director of health and well-being at PHE , said that BMJ 's claims have already been answered in advance .
He said : `` E-cigarettes are far less harmful than smoking . ''
Every second life smoker dies of his addiction .
All the evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are low in comparison , but that we continue to study the long-term effects .
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what is proven and what is not , especially when there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers associated with tobacco .
Almost 80,000 people die each year from a disease with regard to smoking , and smoking costs the national health system £ 2 billion a year .
By clearly presenting current evidence that e-cigarettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking are our national responsibility .
BBC should give up Eastenders , says former chief of Channel 4
The former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said that the BBC should stop sending programs such as Eastenders and The Voice , saying that commercial rivals `` would give their right arm '' for Hitler 's shows , such as Albert Square soap .
Johnson said that the broadcasting fee should only be used to make the kind of programs not sent by other UK donors .
He criticized the BBC for placing public law programs , which are probably seen by a smaller audience , in hard disputed time windows against the most popular shows of their rivals and of broadcasters such as BBC4 .
After the BBC Director-General , Tony Hall , said that companies wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations , Johnson said that for six years he tried to get in touch with the BBC for six years without success .
`` I have problems with the idea that the BBC will order or send programs that would also clearly be shown by non-subsidized rivals , '' Johnson said in his investigation on the future of the BBC .
If you want to keep the radio fee , which I do not regard as a good idea in the medium or long term , you should at least put your production on programmes that others do not do or order .
They send The Voice in a first-class time window because they want to achieve as much support as possible for their future .
The idea that otherwise no one would show this is a joke , it is ridiculous , it is , of course , nonsense .
Johnson said : I do not see why a regressive tax finances programmes that could be funded without subsidies .
The Voice is such a program , Eastenders is another one , admittedly both of its own productions .
To be honest , other channels would give their right arm for it .
I try to see how this should be public service television .
I do not believe that this would reduce the BBC at all .
Johnson , an entrepreneur for series that led Channel 4 from 2004 until 2010 , said that the BBC was to blame for the pursuit of valuations `` because of the ambitions of the people working there , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long-term support . ''
His comments on the most popular broadcasts of the BBC indicate what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , suggested in his Mactaggart talk in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC should sell shows like Eastenders .
Johnson said that the more public niche programs should go `` to BBC4 , where you can not measure the audience , but they fulfill their duties , and they can argue when they go to their hypocritical missions to justify £ 4 billion , '' Well , of course , we have produced all these obscure programs that no one has seen .
They place them in a time window in which nobody ever wanted to see them .
On the radio fee , Johnson said to the committee : I call on you to find a more regressive system in terms of conditions that can get the best value from it .
Of course you think all , we all think that you get a big value for £ 150 per year , but for people who are a lot of money for the 150 £ , I wonder if that is true , because they do not consume much of the BBC .
The former Sky- and Channel 5 boss , David Elstein , who also said to the committee on Tuesday , demanded that the BBC should review its Reithi mission `` to inform , educate and entertain them . ''
He said that only little of BBC production would now be officially classified as education - he said that it is 1 % of its TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and it should take an example on the public television channels in Australia and Canada to change this ' inform , educate and maintain ' .
On the issue of partnerships , Elstein said that the BBC should do more in areas such as that of the Proms , of which he said that only a handful on television will be shown , and enter into commercial channels to make everything online available .
`` Sonosities '' can control brain cells by means of sound waves .
The video shows how the nematodes change the direction at the moment when they are irradiated with sound impulses .
Scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems , which can be controlled by outbreaks of sound waves .
The tiny nematodes change the direction at the moment in which they are irradiated with sound impulses that have high frequencies to listen to the human hearing of high frequencies .
The impulses work by activating motoneuron cells , which are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that react to ultrasonic waves .
Further to this subject : Researchers read and write brain activity with light
The researchers said the worms showed the power of a new method , called Sonotization , which can be used to activate a series of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Rasekanth Chalasani , researchers at the Salk Institute in La Jolla , California , told the Guardian that , one day , the process could replace deep brain stimulation , an invasive process that gives electrical impulses to the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson 's disease .
Fadenworms usually do not react to ultrasound , but Chalasani found that they did when they were surrounded by a liquid with microscopic air bubbles .
The bubbles , he found , reinforce the ultrasonic waves that then penetrate into the worms .
The increased ultrasonic waves act on structures that are called TRP-4 ion channels and are found in the membranes by some of the dice cells .
The sound waves enable the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells to which they are assigned , so a Nature Communications report .
In order to create ultrasonic controlled nematodes , Chalasani genetically changed the worms so that some of its motoneurones carry TRP-4 ion channels .
When he uses ultrasound on the modified creatures , the sound waves are amplified by the microbubbles and transferred to the worms , where they activate the modified Motoneurones .
The process has some similarities with Optophy , a ground-breaking tool , which allows scientists to turn neurons on and off with the impulses of light .
But Chalasani said that Sonotization could have some advantages over this technique .
In contrast to light , which needs to be returned to an optical fiber to the desired position in the brain , low-frequency ultrasonic waves can pass unhindered and can be sent to the brain from the top of the skull .
`` We believe that , with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus , it is possible to make the targeted human neurons temporarily vulnerable to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments , '' said Chalasani .
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin producing cells , he added .

The ads shame the United Kingdom 's arms trade
Watch Amnesty International anti-arms measurement video .
Terrible trafficking drones !
Foot joint crushing bison capsules !
Cluster bombs !
And an electric shock that causes agonising pain , but leaves no trace !
The cheerful voice and the cartoon images are no doubt that this display for the world 's largest arms trade is a combative parody produced by Amnesty International in order to highlight the willingness of the British Government to lay down arms of repressive regimes about the Defence and Security Equipment International Jamboree in London 's Docklands .

But a separate campaign also leads to many posters , which are visible on bus stops and in the metro trains , which require a second glance .
`` Important announcement : Go to DLR from 15 to 18 September '' -LRB- Docklands Light Railway -RRB- will be read in the font types of the London Underground and the trademark of the DLC line , which converts itself to the image of a tank .
In September there will be a swarm of arms dealers with the DLR ... customers are asked to help at the end of the arms trade .
The 300 posters are exhibited by artists who have exhibited their work in the museum of cruel designs in Banksys Dismaland .
A collective with the name of Special Patrol Group helped with the distribution in London and used `` Ad Space hack packs , '' a 6 £ pack of Inbus keys , claiming that `` access to around a third of the bus terminal advertising space on the planet '' was found .
Transport for London does not find this plaque `` vandalism . ''
One of the parody ads produced by Special Patrol Group .
After Gavin Grindon , curator of Crueol designs and lecturer at the University of Essex , artists will become more critical and try to bring political work to the public outside of galleries .
Many artists work with activists within protest movements and notice that they have to go out into the real world , so that their art has an influence on society .
Another of the anti-weapons handball posters greets the pendulum in the underground .
The Amnesty video was regarded as more than 100,000 times in 24 hours over Facebook and was created by the advertising agency VCCP , which works with the graphic artist and Voiceover artist , who is also free of charge .
VCCP creative director Matt Lever was amazed at the silence that prevailed around the advertising of the arms trade - by giving the ExCeL calendar - and thought : `` We give them the campaign to avoid them . ''
They played with the invention of a more realistic , shady corporate advertising , but `` through the insinuation with bright colours and animation , it remains more important . ''
`` You have done a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness of the sale of illegal resale devices at the fair , '' says Tom Davies of Amnesty .
What we need now is the intervention of the British Government and the guarantee that torture equipment will not be traded illegally outside our door .
Perhaps the most creative art around the arms trade comes from the area within Excel , where exhibitors are buying fantastically euphemistic products .
In a press release , Saab revealed a contract of the US Army over `` the AT4CS RS on the shoulder . ''
This includes a `` uniquely shaped combat head that delivers outstanding reverberation effects in the interior of the goal . ''

Eight golden rules for life in student homes
Eleven years ago , as a self-forgotten 19-year-old , I moved to a student residence , still in faith in Berets and moral relativism , but only now I remember the tense smile of those I annoyed - and the many , long-lasting complaints about others .
Most of what I have learned can be distilled in eight simple rules .
The entrance to student residences ranges from easily annoying and absolutely frightening .
It 's tempting : People tell where you know where you are , where you are in relation to Corbyn , where you are in relation to Corbyn and why you do not love or hate Marmite , because in Ernst , guys , it 's just a yeast HAHAHA , I am in my room .
Breathe in .
And help others to do the same , ask questions and show interest .
It guides the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like , contrary to those you would not talk to , even if your eyebrows were on fire and these fire extinguishers would be .
Let people .
The rooms of people are often transformed into beverage recipes , film night venues and communal meeting points , but they are also the places where people attract and wear their underwear .
Referring to this : Do not think about going to the university with a relationship ...
Introverted received a rough treatment at the university .
Your room should be a haven of refuge , but many student homes form a room / / room culture that is friendly and sociable and can lead to lifelong friendship .
That can be the hell for someone who tries to recover .
Nothing in culture allows you to say , `` I like you , and I want our friendship to continue , but you must go away to get the energy I have consumed for interaction with you . ''
Try to see when a commilitone of conviviality has been exhausted - and send him an SMS instead .
Listen to Apropos : Do it .
A guy in my student homes had the idea that an unlocked door was an invitation .
He saw some things .
Friendship close through baking .
As you start with the university at the height of the baking mania , the clopsis to the doors of people to present with a plate full of brownies , less strange than the welcome of the 1950-ER years `` Welcome to the neighborhood , I have baked something , and now smile when I ask you some personal questions . ''
Offering homemade goodies is a good way to make friends .
The villagers feel obliged to entertain themselves and , at the end of the day , may associate your face with a delicious surprise .
Of course , this depends on whether you are a decent baker .
Bad missing spills from flour , sugar and fat lead to people sleeping when you knock .
Stealing food is a common crime in student homes .
Of course , the claws of chicken is a theft , but is the take of a drop of milk for your tea ?
Check it with the dairy owner .
The chances are that they say to serve themselves , even if they cook inside .
If someone steals your belongings , it is annoying , and you have my sympathy - but try to be more balanced than my fellow resident , who added a dishwasher to their milk in order to punish thieves .
It is now in prison .
You should not make a noise that prevents people from sleeping or from work .
It is not just a question of being a decent person , but that you literally belong to the people sitting in the glass house .
A girl in my hall asked her neighbors whether they were doing anything about drum & bass , because it was 3 o 'clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning .
She responded with even more music .
Finally , when she came up at 5 o 'clock , she allowed her neighbors to sleep for two hours before she broke her own music , closed her door and went to her three-hour check .
Would it not be romantic if your future spouse were to enter the same student residence ?
Conversely , it would not be fundamentally embarrassing if you consider a woman to stick to your future marriage , go to her , separate again and see her every day , and perhaps witness the way in which she brings all the common friends ?
Of course , the heart goes its own way - but , if a hot woman is definitely not your future spouse , you at least try to have a little sense of reason .
In the exciting moment you notice that someone has left his keys in his closed room , the boundary between an Ulk and bullying is finer than it seems .
A good fortune is funny , but it only takes moments until it becomes a boomerang .
Give yourself a valuable and amusing lesson about safety by creating a valuable and amusing lesson about safety - but never treat yourself to someone 's room with toothpaste and shampoo .
Close your door and put your keys in a glass of water , which will put you in the freezer - but you will not attack your possessions on the ceiling more than twice .
Terraced houses for refugees , single parents , low-income
The real estate contractor , Markus Gildner , is building terraced houses for people who do not have a lot of money .
For example , for refugees - but also as a signal : `` it is not only refugees who need housing , but also the single mother and the underpaid . ''
`` I show how you can still build well today , '' says the 44-year old in the interview
Thousands of refugees will push into the housing market .
The entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes to know how quickly cheap housing can be created : It is built in a project terraced houses for refugees .
Mr Gildner , many refugees will push for the housing market .
What solution do you offer ?
Markus Gildner : Mass accommodation in containers or gyms has no sustainability .
For the people remain to a large extent here .
In the face of the flow of refugees , we also need sufficient housing in the next few decades .
A very small , three-storey terraced house is the solution .
Gildner : A terraced house needs the least space .
It facilitates integration .
This is different when people are caught in residential blocks .
Each of the six houses built in the pilot project consists of three accommodation units for four asylum seekers each .
Each residential unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a lounge .
It may be that many refugees will say it is again peace , I go back .
Then the houses can be easily converted to their respective needs .
What are the costs ?
Gildner : The price of 160 square meters per house amounts to 184 000 euros , without land .
That is manageable .
Six months has taken the building .
That is appropriate .
Did the construction regulations complicate their plans ?
Gildner : I have correctly passed my project .
It is always the most complicated thing about the threat of the Damoklesschwert special construction and the regulation of the parking space .
Gruselig .
It is still implied that those who create three apartments in a terraced house need at least three pitches .
Only in the cities there is no room for this .
And refugees and asylum seekers do not have cars .
How did the residents respond to their terraced house project ?
Gildner : There were those who have accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers .
That is definitely not the case .
But do you not exacerbate the competition for affordable housing ?
Gildner : It is true that we have had a construction boom in Germany over the past five years , but we have built luxury apartments , which can hardly afford any more .
My project has the message , including the normal people need housing .
Not only refugees , but also the single mother or the poor .
I show how you can still be cheap and good today .
That is what it is about .

IOS 9 : How you get the new iPhone operating system when Apple Update is released
The new operating system can be requested by going to the settings app , type `` General '' type and then select `` Software Update . ''
If it is ready , the phone will give you the option to download and then to install it .
Some have encountered problems after installation , as they get an error message indicating that the `` software update has failed . ''
In order to avoid the problem , users are advised either to wait until the mount goes back or try to upgrade from iTunes .
The phone itself takes you through the rest of the process .
This may mean deleting apps in order to make space - but Apple has made it less likely by streamlining the update , and it will be easier to do this when you use a special tool to delete apps and then reinstall them once the process has been completed .
It is worth ensuring that your mobile phone is charged during the upgrade or is close to a charger so that the battery is loaded .
If the charge is too low , Apple does not allow the update to continue , as the phone may switch to half way and this could lead to a termination of the update .
News : IOS 9 release is still released in the schedule despite the WatchOS delay in the review of iOS 9 : The least exciting , but the best update of iOS 9 : How to prepare for the new iPhone system
You should also ensure that before you download our checklist of all things , to prevent things from running incorrectly and to protect yourself if they do , iOS 9 brings new features , including a much smarter personal assistant and huge new productivity features for the iPad , as well as changes that accelerate and repair the operating system .
Rosberg 's sole motto : Full Attack
Nico Rosberg is familiar with the fight for the World Championship title in Formula 1 against his clearly leading Mercedes team mate , Lewis Hamilton : `` Volle Attack . ''
The World Cup second pointed to the start of the decisive seven overseas races , `` that I have nothing more to lose . ''
53 points separate the vice champion from Singapore on this Sunday of title defender and second champion Hamilton .
The Briton has already won seven of the twelve season races , and is also a favorite in the city-state .
In 2009 and last year the 30-year-old Brite could win the race .
Whether the current smog in the city state will have an impact on the Great Price of Singapore , it is still unclear .
For several days , a dune bell hangs over the city , triggered by fires on the neighbouring island of Sumatra .
Bad Kissinger Chess is a prominent member
The chess club `` Chess Bad Kissingen '' founded three months ago , has joined a new member in its ranks , so the number of members increased to 19 players .
The new member is the entrepreneur Paul Gauselmann , a passionate chess and tennis player , who has been living in Bad Kissingen for more than 40 years .
Gauselmann is the bearer of the Federal Cross of Merit , 1st class and honorary citizen of the towns of Espelkamp and Lübbecke .
The chess club in Bad Kissingen has helped Gauselmann with a donation made by Chairman Alfred Klein .
This makes it possible to include chess players who can not have the membership fee .
Youth work and talent search are also to be promoted .
Gauselmann hopes that membership in the chess club and friendly contact with the tennis club `` Rot-Weiss '' is seen as an expression of its commitment to the spa city .
District office is looking for direct contact
Saludis and the centre of the Altenzentrum , Antonistift , have joined together under the cloak of the Social Foundation and opened a new point of contact at the Graf-Stauffenberg Square .
In addition to consultations , you can also take part in courses .
The Social Foundation takes it down from the mountain into the city centre .
Specifically , the Graf-Stauffenberg course .
A new district office was opened there recently .
Here , right next to the shopping market , we now receive information on questions such as care insurance or care services .
For years , we have established with our out-patient care service , that often nursing relatives are left alone .
There are an infinite number of questions .
`` Also , the complexity of the insurance is not often used , because the complexity of the insurance can hardly be understood , '' explained the new owner of Jutta Weigand , who is also responsible for the Antonistift and the Civil Hospital and for the outpatient service `` Amadeus . ''
In addition to the consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness .
To this end , the Saludis was taken on board .
Therefore , it is possible to use additional offers such as storm prevention , memory training or physiotherapeutic treatment .
The offers from the senior centre and the Saludis complement each other in an ideal way .
Saludis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation .
`` The senior center for care and care , '' described Heike Riedel , director of Saludis .
The reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre sees both business leaders particularly in demographic change .
For this a good decentralised infrastructure in the individual districts of Bamberg are essential in the future .
In addition , Mayor Wolfgang Metzner -LRB- SPD -RRB- emphasized the celebration of the opening ceremony , and the district office is also dedicated to the club 's association : `` There are a lot of events and offers on the programme , and they invite to a regular convivial get-together . ''
In this way , the Social Foundation makes a major contribution to the fact that senior citizens can live in their familiar environment as independently as possible .
The district office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 : 00 to 14 : 00 , Tuesday and Thursday from 16 a.m. to 6 p.m. and on Saturdays from 10 : 00 to 12 : 00 .
Bamberg against Würzburger Kickers on the 6th of October
Now it 's official : After having not yet reached the date of FC Einharmony Bamberg against the third party of the Kickers , the 6th October has now been set as a date .
The meeting of the FC Einharmony Bamberg in the eighth final of the Bavarian Football Totopokals against the third part of the FC Würzburger Kickers was finally cancelled .
It will be played on Tuesday , October 6th , at 19 : 00 in the Bamberger Fuchsparkstadion .
`` We are glad that we now know when the game is on stage , now we have planning security , '' says Team Manager Karlheinz Hümmer .
It is special for our team to play against a third party .
We are therefore hoping for a large number of spectators , not without reason , because floodlight games have a special charm .
In the round of the last 16 teams , the FC Eintracht Bamberg 2010 moved to FC Oberhaid -LRB- 3 : 1 -RRB- and at home against the regional ligists 1st FC Schweinfurt 05 -LRB- 3 : 2 -RRB- .
The winner of the contest will receive 5,000 euros and will qualify for the first round of the DFB Club in 2016 / 2017 .
The title defender is third player SpVgg Unterhaching .
Vienna architect Karl Mang 92-year-old
Karl Mang , one of the Doyens of the Viennese architecture , is dead .
He died on the 5th of September at the age of 92 , as the artist 's house arranged on Tuesday .
With Mang , the artist house loses an honorary member and also `` one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna , '' as stated in the programme .
Born in Vienna in 1922 , Mang studied architecture during and after World War II at the Technical University in Vienna at Friedrich Lehmann .
Since 1952 he has been working as a freelance architect , but he has also worked as a teacher , writer and editor .
From 1972 to 1983 , he was president of the Austrian Institute of Design .
In the 1980s , he was appointed to the Austrian Theatre Museum with the establishment of the treasury in the Vienna Hofburg and the reconstruction of the Palais Lobkowitz .
Penalty : TIM meadow is a police officer with money .
Former footballer Tim meadow was noticed in Bremen .
Footballer was once , Tim meadow , the former national guard in Germany and in Bremen and Hoffenheim , Wrestler .
30 kilograms of muscle mass , he wants to have added to his own statement over the past two years .
Intellectually , he did not accept it .
At the end of the 19th century , he was a member of the German Grand Prix of the United States of America .
Meadow then stormed out of the shop , insulting the official and accusing her of the guilty fine in front of his feet , as the `` picture '' newspaper reports .
The city of Bremen confirms the accusations , but is not yet aware of the consequences for the unusual incident .
`` The thing is still in the test , '' it is from the city of Bremen .

Men have been beating about 17-year-old Afghans
Witnesses are looking for the police for an incident in Bad Soden-Salmünster : On Friday night , at 11.45 p.m. , three young men were walking from Bad Soden in the direction of Salmünster .
One from the group , a 17 years of old Afghani , followed by the police of his two friends in a distance of about five meters , urging them to wait for him .
At that time the group was at the height of the pit station .
There were also three people living in the petrol station .
One of these men now shouted young people and struck it with the fist .
In this case , the victim suffered a breach of the nose and blood .
When his two friends rushed in and complained to the racquet , he first dropped from his victim .
From his friends , the injured young man has now been brought to home .
The perpetrator pursued the group with a car up to its home and passed a demonstration on several occasions .
When you no longer saw the car , the injured went to the building to smoke a cigarette .
There he was attacked again by the racquet and another male person .
With the help of a stroke , you check on the face and thighs of the victim .
The injured had to be brought to hospital for the purpose of medical care .
So far there is only one vague description of the subject .
One of the men was about 1.80 meters .
The second racquet is said to have been about 1.65 meters and was dressed with a jeans and a brown white shirt .
The police ask witnesses and signers to register under the phone number 06181 / 100-123 .
Dr. Frank Müller takes over practice and invests 310,000 Euro .
Silvia Müller-Gongoll and Frank Müller -LRB- from the left -RRB- take over the practice of Karl-Heinrich and Ursel .
We are also looking forward to the opening of a new competition in the Czech Republic .
In many places in the country there are no doctors - Asendorf is lucky : On 1 October , Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice of field breaks .
While Ursel is retiring , her husband , Karl-Heinrich , will be joining his successor in half a place in the next few months .
After a reconstruction phase , Müller opens up the practice on 12 October , and until then he invested 310000 euros in the premises at the St. Marcellusstraße 6 .
It was sympathy at the first glance , when the band met Frank Müller and his wife , Dr. Silvia Müller-Gongoll , who is currently completing her medical education in the late hospital and also wants to enter the practice in practice .
`` We have always thought that the refuse would be well suited to this practice , '' says Dr. Ursel Felurausen and laughs .
`` When it was , I just called them . ''
The couple Müller liked the idea of pursuing his own practice in Asendorf .
`` The proximity and the constant contact with the patients is very attractive to us , '' says the 39-year-old Müller .
`` We want to meet and accompany the families over the years . ''
As an advantage , he also look to be his own boss .
And so it was agreed that the Müllers bought the house with the practice .
However , they will continue to live in quarry Vilsen .
There , the two-time family father , Frank Müller , grew up , and his medical studies in Hannover followed in several medical practices and in the hospitals in Sulingen , Nienburg and Rotenburg .
At the moment he works as a doctor in Sulingen , and in 2009 he was appointed as a medical doctor in the circle of Diepholz .
From 19 September the practice will be prepared for the new boss .
During the course of the surgery , Dr. Karl-Heinrich Felurausen , a family doctor , has specialised in the field of gastroenterology .
The Müllers , both internists , want to settle as house doctors .
`` The endoscopy comes out , '' says the 38-year-old Silvia Müller-Gongoll .
After reconstruction , the rooms will look modern .
We will offer more ultrasound tests as well as long-term and load ECGs , and we need a speech room more .
In addition , the computer is completely renewed .
A grant of a total of 50000 euros is given to the refuse within the framework of a funding programme of the district -LRB- 25000 euros -RRB- , as well as from the sperm community -LRB- 12500 euros -RRB- and the municipality -LRB- 12500 euros -RRB- .
`` This shows how proud and happy we are that the practice will be continued , '' says teacher owner Bernd Bormann .
For about 2000 patients , according to Silvia Müller-Gongoll , each quarter comes into practice in the practice of field breaks , in which average practice in North Germany is about 500 patients .
In Asendorf there is also another domestic medical practice .
A positive side effect of Frank Müller 's assumption of practice : The pharmacy remains in Asendorf according to Ursel .
If no successor had emerged , it would have gone .
Anyone who visits Müller 's speech will continue to look in familiar faces : The seven medical workers and the cleaning power of the field .
Their departure ends in Asendorf , and after all , the physicians practiced it for 30 years .
`` At the beginning , we only had two rooms , '' Ursel remembers the rest of the world .
After the long time , there is a lack of sadness .
`` But we continue to live in Hohenmoor and will certainly see many patients still often , '' says the boarding school .
Your husband is laughing : `` We have a 6000-square plot . ''
`` I have always pressed myself against gardening work , now it could be different . ''
In addition , the couple has two grandchildren and like to travel .
Croatia : `` We let the refugees through ''
`` Well , border controls are also being driven by our southern border , '' said Home Minister Johanna Mikl-Bardtner .
The controls on the Hungarian border remain parallel to this .
It is still clear that anyone who wants to make an application for asylum can do this `` of course . ''
The supply and safety of the people are at the forefront .
But it is also clear that `` it needs clear signals , '' said the Minister .
People need to know that we do not accept boundless migratory flows , including the Austro-Hungarian border .
It needs a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering `` corridor '' - Slovenia
The Croatian Government had previously announced that Slovenia would also allow incoming refugees to travel in the direction of Austria and Germany and may also establish corridors for the refugees .
In this way , the interior minister Vesna Györkös Znidar in Ljubljana did not see it .
The idea of corridors is `` absolutely unacceptable '' - Slovenia is going to step up the monitoring of the border , especially Hungary .
The border with Croatia , on the other hand , is already heavily controlled as an external border of the Schengen area .
As the Minister has pointed out , Slovenia does not want to put its borders on refugees , however .
`` Every EU member must fill out his obligations , otherwise the system can not work , '' said Györkös Znidar .
As the Croatian Government has pointed out , the first refugees had already tried in the night hours on Tuesday to pass in Eastern Croatia at the border crossing Tovarnik / Sid in order to avoid the registration .
The Croatian police were able to pick up them in the nearby corn fields .
According to local media , since then , in the Croatian Tovarnik , police vehicles are constantly meeting with new refugees .
These are mainly Syrians and Afghans , including many women and children .
Rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
In the coming days , his country is counting on around 4,000 refugees , said Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic .
In addition , Presevo buses on the Macedonian Serb border , which had so far brought migrants to the Hungarian border , would be redirected to Croatia , reporting Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
The government in Belgrade , however , insisted that it would be wise to take on certain routes : `` we can do it , nor do we want to do that , '' it said .
According to the media reports , in any case , in the morning , a first bus with about 50 refugees in the Serbian border town has arrived , and further buses would be expected in the course of the day .
Via Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
Throughout the night , the detainees were taken from Serbia by the approximately 500 kilometres of the Macedonian border .
`` We have heard that Hungary has done , so the police told us that we should go here , '' said one of the refugees .
They wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
In fact , in fact , the postponement of the Balkan route , which has already been predicted by observers , could , in fact , be a somewhat Western route to the former Balkan Route of Turkey , Macedonia , Macedonia , Macedonia .
Croatia : `` Change opportunities for border control ''
Croatia 's Interior Minister , Mr Ostojic , had previously stressed that his country had prepared appropriate plans for exceptional situations for the case of a strong influx of refugees .
He did not mention details , but he pointed out that Croatia , as a non-Schengen member , has `` comprehensive border control options . ''
Take strict controls to qualify for membership of the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , and the EU partners have demonstrated a good testimony to the country since then , as far as the standard of border controls are concerned .
On the Serbian side , there are still about 300 refugees behind the Hungarian border fence .
According to Belgrade 's media reports , they would have spent the last night at the border of Horgos , which leads to Röszke .
According to the Hungarian authorities , the two crossing points of Horgos and Backi Breg remain completely closed .
Whether the remaining refugees want to travel to the Croatian border , it is still unclear .
The Serbian Interior Minister , Nebojsa Stefanovic , tried to reassure Wednesday morning on a local eye note in Horgos : He considers the debates about alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed , for premature .
It would not be a very large number of refugees at the moment .
We can not say yet whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or any other country .
Helpers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
However , private Hungarian refugee workers have already started to distribute maps to the refugees on which alternative routes have been drawn by Croatia .
However , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : In parts of the border area , 20 years after the end of the Croatian war , there are still closed mines .
On Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine planners had been sent to the border region .
Market Hacker : Ukrainians pay $ 30 million .
Supranonok is said to have heard about a ring of cybercriminals who has been accused of having an insight into even unreleased financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire , Marketwired and PR Newswire since 2010 .
The exploited information is meant to be insider trading in the financial markets .
In this way , the investigators were given a total of over $ 100 million .
`` Today 's comparison shows that even those outside our own borders are caught , '' it is said in the SEC communication .
The trials against 32 other suspects in the case lasted .
Most of the defendants come from Ukraine and Georgia .
The perpetrators should have acted both in the US and in Eastern Europe .
Mannheim has been in existence for 20 years .
There is an active operation around the Mannheim fairground .
The people do their concerns , sometimes fast steps , partly cosy .
You control the two stops of the Mannheim Autosalons at the showcase .
There is a lot of city railways .
Vibrant , good life with a wonderful autumn sun , and in the middle of four big panels with the title `` I would like to die . ''
With this action , the Ecumenical hospice Action drew attention to its 20 years of existence and looks forward to mixed reactions .
`` It is about life , so we have gone to the city and to the people , '' says Josefine Lammer .
The head of the Ecumenical hospice Aid is available to the passers-by as well as for questions and discussions such as the volunteer staff .
Time and again small discussions about the action in itself , about life , the handling of death .
Peter Hübinger is also on the ground .
`` Only when I make it clear that for me the end comes to this world at some point , I can live responsibly , '' says the director of the Diakonic Works Mannheim , together with the Caritasverband carrier of Ocumenical hospice Aid .
That is why this high-profile action for the age of 20 is good .
The fact that not everyone wants to communicate on the plates is understandable , but it is a very personal thing .
The issue of death and death is still taboo , as is the experience of Josefine Lammer , although , in recent years , the hospice movement has done much to open up people .
An assessment shared by Angelika Godefroid .
The funeral and funeral service is one of the volunteers of the first hour .
By personally experiencing the subject , she read a lot of literature and decided to engage in euthanasia .
When the Ecumenical hospice aid searched for volunteers by appeal , she immediately reported and was in the process of establishing it in 1995 .
Godefroid belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the person concerned and relatives in private households , hospitals , nursing homes and in Hospiz Sankt Vincent .
They are all carefully trained .
Angelika Godefroid can deal well with her task and her experiences and experiences .
`` I see the life of another waiting , it seems precious and appreciate the moment , '' she says .
The offer of the outpatient Ecumenical hospice Service is free and independent of religion .
The financial support of the health insurance companies and donations of family members and associations allows for the training and training and supervisions of the dying family .
Every two years , training is provided for new employees .
The panels described on Saturday are now exhibited in the house of the Protestant Church -LRB- M1 , 1a -RRB- and in the house of the Catholic Church -LRB- F2 , 6 -RRB- .
Further personal wishes can be noted on postcards as well .
Mixing Fedex Results , Financial prospects for 2016
Fedex reports disappointing results for the last quarter , and the supply giant lowered its earnings outlook for a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its Bodentransport service .
The company also said that it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers .
At that time last year , Fedex announced that the company would like to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period .
The share fell above 2.5 % in pre-market trading 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
Fedex Corp. said to earn a profit of $ 10.40 and $ 10.90 in the fiscal year that ends next May , 20 cents less than in the previous forecast .
According to a survey of FactSet 10.84 , analysts expected .
In spite of the price increases , which averages 4.9 % on average , and despite higher charges for ground transport of heavy and large packages , which are raised in November , the lower perspective will occur on average on 4 January .
The company said that it still expects the result to be increased compared to the previous year because of cost reduction , higher revenue , and because of growth in online trading .
Chairman and CEO , Fred Smith , said that the company produces `` solid returns if you consider less than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . ''
The plans for holiday employment were announced a day later than that of the rival UPS , which is planning to hire 90.000 to 95,000 additional workers , such as the same number as in last year .
In the quarter that ended on 31 August , Fedex earned $ 692 million , 6 % more than in the previous year .
Earnings per share amounted to $ 2.42 per share , just behind the $ 2.44 per share , which predicted 12 analysts from Zacks Investment Research .
Sales rose by 5 percent to $ 12.3 billion .
Six analysts asked by Zacks expected $ 12.23 billion .
In recent years , Fedex has recorded a decline in international priority shipments , which brought the turnover in its unit express shipping to the station .
But the boom in online shopping has increased the results of Fedex Ground .
In the last quarter , sales in ground transport rose by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self-insurance .
The express unit recorded higher revenues on the basis of higher prices , while the result fell on account of higher labor costs in the freight business .
In pre-market trading , about one hour before the opening , Fedex shares fell by $ 3,85 , or 2.5 percent , to $ 150,15 .
On Tuesday , they concluded 11 percent of the year and 17 percent below a record high on 11 June .
On their most anticipated meeting in the year , Federal Reserve strategists spend two days this week around a 27-foot Islamist mahogany table to decide whether it is time to raise the policy rate for the first time in almost a decade .
A wall of the United States is found over them at an end of the decorated , two-story chamber .
The card is a reminder that Fed Chairman Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
The central bank has a dual mandate from Congress : Keep US employment and prices stable here .
But , since the Great Recession , the Fed has recognized that there is an unwritten third mandate : Financial stability .
And this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too narrow to predict it .
While most of the economic data show that it is growing well , the recent turbulence in global financial markets could make the already prudent stock leaders anxious to increase this volatility by raising the interest rate for federal bonds - and be only a quarter of a percentage point .
`` It is obvious that the labour market and inflation will primarily be the most important thing they observe , '' said Lindsey M. Piegza , chief economist at the brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co .
`` But I think if they were looking for a pretext for not increasing the interest rate , the heightened uncertainty around the global market is enough justification to continue to wait , '' she said .
There is no consensus on what the Fed is going to do , which in itself is uncertain about the financial market .
About half of the economists recently questioned by Bloomberg have predicted a rate hike this week .
But financial markets are waiting for the Fed to wait , with a key indicator that displays only a 30 % chance of an increase .
This points to a decline in the stock market if the Fed increases the rate , unless strategists promise to mitigate the blow by promising that a further increase is far away .
On Tuesday , the Dow Jones industrial average jumped by 228.89 points or 1.4 % to 16.599,85 .
The action was triggered by expectations that Fed policy maintains the rate this week , said John Lonski , Chief Economist at Moody 's Capital Markets Research Group .
It would be a surprise if the Fed would raise the rates at that time , he said .
If it does , `` it would have to go very far in its explanation to reassure financial markets so that it does not panic . ''
Other experts argued that a rate hike would reassure financial markets , because it would eliminate uncertainty about when the Fed would act .
A month ago , the Fed seemed on track to raise the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Yellen said in the spring and in early summer that this year , despite the complaints from the liberals that more economic progress would be needed , they expect an increase in the rate .
Although job creation slowed in August , the improvement on the labour market was solid this year .
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1 % last month , the lowest in more than seven years and close to the level that the Fed considers as full employment .
Wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
And , although inflation has always been below the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the members of the country said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
The economy `` can manage higher interest rates and needs it because of the tension in the labor market , '' said Ian Shepherunger , the chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics .
But financial markets around the world met at the end of last month , after China devalued its currency .
The Dow Jones Industrial average fell by more than 16 % in May , when investors feared that a slowdown in the Chinese economy would reduce global growth .
The market has recovered this month , with the Dow now lying at almost 10 % under the Hoch of May .
Market turbulence influences the complex calculation of market turbulence , when interest rates should be increased .
`` If the events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the past few weeks , they would attract the reins , '' said Stephen D. Oliner , Senior Research Fellow at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former Fed employee .
He is now predicting that she will wait at least one month to get the impact better .
`` There is a lot of uncertainty about what the effects on the US economy will have , and there is almost no reliable data that describe developments in China , '' said Oliner .
The health of the global economy is not one of the Fed 's main concerns , so it should not be technically included in its decision-making process .
But , in the end , the Fed has become the world 's monetary authority .
The influence of the Central Bank has been enormous in recent years .
The mere indication that the then leader of Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 was that the Fed could `` narrow '' its monetary expansion triggered confusion around the globe .
In a world in which markets and economies are increasingly interwoven , the Feast Party can be expected not only to monitor developments elsewhere , but also to advise with other central banks and experts in order to gain a better understanding of the global economy .
Their decision-making is `` more art than science , '' said Zachary Karabell , head of the global strategy for the asset management of Envestnet Inc .
Jeffrey Lacker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond , VA , said this month that `` the Fed has a history of over-reactions to financial market movements that are apparently not linked to economic fundamentals . ''
Lacker , voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee , for an interest hike , quoted decisions in 1998-1999 as an example .
A financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to reduce its interest rate by 0.75 percentage points in three sessions , `` despite limited identifiable effects on growth in the US , '' said Lacker .
One year later , these cuts were reversed by the Feast Members .
The Fed should place aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis such as the 2008 market collapse , said Adam S. poses , a former member of the Board of Governors of the Bank of England .
The recent turbulence does not come near this level , he said .
`` They certainly do not want to get into the situation in which they are afraid of an increase in interest , because the markets are becoming more exciting , '' said Poznan , President of the Peterson Institute for International Economics .
The Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until that is changed , I do not believe that it should come before time .

Hoyerswerda : Small Life Aid for Refugees
More and more refugees are coming in Germany these days .
A warm welcome can not be done without the commitment of countless volunteers .
Also in Hoyerswerda there are a whole series of people who support altruistic asylum seekers in the city .
These include Petra and Klaus Heine .
Petra Heine is a teacher with body and soul .
Also with her 74 lungs she is still happy to teach .
Every Thursday she does it in the asylum seeker at the Dillinger Straße .
It helps refugees from Syria , Kurdistan , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language .
Of course , this is a very different lesson than a proper school .
Brazil 's paediatric society , Rio Grande , promotes nutrition for healthy breastfeeding
The Brazilian paediatric organization SPRS is trying to investigate the importance of good nutrition during breastfeeding , with the presentation of images of babies who suck in breasts painted by unhealthy foods .
Breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates , which give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
Due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant women and young mothers will have to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day .
However , new research suggests that a higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should do .
A recent study led by Robert Waterland , Professor at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumors .
Unfortunately , an unhealthy diet of the child can have a negative effect on the immune system .
Exceptions for the new Bernrieder Sports Hall
The municipal council at Bernried approved the construction request for the 2.3 million euro expensive sports hall .
And he made an exception .
The roof must be flatter for solar panels .
The planning for the long awaited gym building at the Bernrieder Sports Park takes step by step : In the most recent municipal meeting , the completed construction application was unanimously approved without great discussion .
Previously , the panel also adopted a request for a structural `` exception '' or `` exemption '' from the current construction plan .
The `` exception '' was about permission for a special form relating to the construction of the roof .
Thus , a `` saddle roof with non-attached first and roof top '' is to be built .
The background to the planning is the planned use of the roof area for solar panels : `` This gives us a wonderfully large south roof , '' explained Mayor Josef Steigenberger in the meeting .
In the case of `` liberation , '' it was , in turn , the propensity of the roof , which , for energetic reasons , is said to be different than in the construction plan , below ten degrees .
This significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
A `` liberation '' was needed , because the construction plan for the propensity of the roof does not allow `` exceptions '' - the rule of the Bernrieder municipal council as a rule more restrictive in the case of liberating applications .
However , this is not a recurring project : `` We do n't create a precedent , '' says Steigenberger .
The sport centre is a joint project of the community and SV Bernried .
At the cost , some EUR 2.3 million is calculated .
Grants are expected from school and grassroots support .
In the next step of the procedure , the construction request for the 18 x 36 meter large hall will now be submitted to the landing party .
Clinic Peißenberg moves to Schongau
The hospital Peißenberg is planned to be closed in the past - in 2016 .
At the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer -LRB- 66 -RRB- will be the new medical director at Schongau Hospital .
The station and the majority of employees move from Peißenberg to Schongau .
This is seen by the surprising plans of the Hospital GmbH of the district , confirmed by agricultural company Andrea Jochner-weiß .
However , a decision on this will be decided by the Supervisory Board and the meeting will meet next Wednesday , 23 September .
If the plans were to be implemented , all of the almost 50 employees at the hospital in Peißenberg would be employed .
The vast majority should move to Schongau with fishermen and the existing internal station .
The rooms are available .
The staff who can not get to Schongau is to be offered a job in Weilheim , so Jochner-weiß .
The staff are aware of the plans .
The change was caused by the cancellation of Dr. Andreas Eder , who has only been a medical director of the Schongauer Clinic since the beginning of the year and now changes to a private practice in the immediate vicinity of the hospital .
On the question of who is to succeed , according to Jochner-weiß , the name `` Fischer '' came into the game , who agreed to take the lead from 1 October and to switch with his team to Schongau .
For the house in Schongau , this is , in any case , an `` appreciation '' and a widening of the offer in the field of `` internal medicine , '' Jochner-weiß .
Fischer is a specialist for pacemakers and defibrillators .
Schongau -LRB- 180 beds -RRB- is specialized in gastroenterological diseases .
For the next two years , fishermen with their team , if the Supervisory Board agrees to this , will lead both houses , until next year the former hospital in the factory , which still has 35 beds , is to be closed in Peißenberg after almost 140 years .
Up to now , the district had planned this for 2018 if the current rehabilitation at the hospital in Weilheim is completed .
Councillor Jochner-weiß , who is also chairman of the Supervisory Board , decided that the House , which is owned by the Federal Government , should in future be used as an accommodation for asylum seekers .
`` That 's what I mean , '' as it continues with the property , Jochner-White could not say that there were several considerations .
At the moment , there is a short-term care of Caritas and a tagespsyship house .
`` What happens better could not happen to us , such an opportunity did not happen again , '' says Fischer , who has been admitted to Lech , who has been given a `` positive and very understanding '' approach .
There has not been a real prospect for the house where fishermen have been working as a doctor for over 30 years .
He was asked by Schongauer colleagues to take over the post of medical director .
The hospital Peißenberg -LRB- once 100 beds -RRB- has been threatened with closure in recent decades , departments have been closed , for example , surgery and obstinacy .
The handball of the Rhine-Neckar lions is required this evening -LRB- 20.15 -RRB- at the Bergisches HC .
The leader of the Bundesliga is the clear favorite in Wuppertal , but there is no reason for arrogance .
In the last season , the bathers took a painful defeat at the BHC and had something good there .
Hunting case with two injured at Pratau
Two tractor drivers were seriously injured during their corn harvest on Tuesday afternoon .
During the demolition of a corn field at Pratau -LRB- Wittenberg County -RRB- , several hunters were used , as the police pointed out .
After a fire charge , a 6 and a 22-year-old man suffered serious injuries and were brought to hospitals .
How exactly the accident was possible , it was initially unclear .
The crime police have been identified .
Missing 16-year-old from the Rhineland-Palatinate victims of violent crimes
A suspect has led the police to the head of the 16-year-old woman from Rhineland-Palatinate , who has been missing since Saturday .
In the interrogation , the 20 year-old has been able to kill young people and throw their corpses into a channel in Rockenhausen .
A 16-year-old from Rhineland-Palatinate has been a victim of violent crime since Saturday .
The corpse of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rockenhausen near Kaiserslautern , such as the public prosecutor and the police on Wednesday .
In fact , a 20 year-old , who was arrested on Tuesday evening , was said to have been arrested and led by the investigators to find the site of the corpse .
The 16-year-old was missing on Sunday morning after she did not come to home on the eve of a visit to Rockenhausen on the eve of a visit to Rockenhausen .
In the search for the young woman , the investigators initially met with personal objects of the victim .
Finally , in the case of interviews in the circle of friends and acquaintances of the missing persons , there was a suspicion of action against the age of 20 .
The alleged perpetrator then led the police into a channel in Rockenhausen , where the corpse was found .
According to the authorities , the authorities were in the police interrogation , who killed 16 years and placed the corpse in the channel .
The 20 year-old should be presented to the port judge on Wednesday , and the investigators blame him for death .
The further investigation is intended to shed light on the further circumstances of the act .
Refugees need accommodation : Study warns of the housing gap
The situation on the German housing market is tense .
More and more refugees are also looking for affordable accommodation .
The pressure on the housing market is growing .
Social housing is facing a challenge .
The distribution campaigns on the German housing market have long begun .
With the incoming refugees and job seekers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that has already been overburdened in many major cities .
They compete with low-income citizens for the last affordable housing .
To meet the demand for affordable housing , 400,000 new units would have to be built every year by 2020 .
This is the result of a study on behalf of the association `` social housing . ''
By comparison : This year , 260,000 units are being completed in Germany .
As a result , there are a shortage of 140,000 homes .
After the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seekers in a first-time accommodation .
Many then meet on the housing market and enter the long queues in front of the apartments .
However , according to the German Federal Statistical Office , less than half of all asylum seekers lived for rent in the last year .
However , the negative development of the housing market is not just about the increasing numbers of refugees .
The study also makes significant omissions in the housing policy of recent years .
Germany is facing a housing deficit that is growing year after year .
Matthias Günther , the author of the study , has already lamented a shortage of about 750,000 units .
Many professionals therefore lived in large cities in WG rooms .
Young adults involuntarily stay longer in `` Hotel Mama '' because of the slack on the housing market .
In the major cities , the number of square meters per capita in recent years has declined for the first time .
In order to solve the problem , the alliance `` social housing '' is proposing a restart .
New incentives are intended to restore social housing .
In this way , the basic value tax could be abandoned and the basic tax on subsidised housing could be suspended for a temporary period .
Moreover , according to the alliance , attractive tax depreciation options are needed .
The support programme for refugee accommodation of the state-owned bank KfW is already coming well in cities and communities .
A good week after the start , on Monday evening , with EUR 184 million , more than half of the EUR 300 million available had been picked up .
Now the project could even be increased .
Refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia set up a corridor
After Hungary , virtually no progress has been made , as more and more refugees are choosing the way over Croatia .
Zagreb announces that it will travel through Slovenia to the north without any obstacles .
However , the route is dangerous .
Croatia wants to agree with the neighbouring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
`` I spoke to the Slovenian Minister of Interior , and if it is necessary , we will organise a corridor , '' said Croatian Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic .
Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria and belongs to the Schengen zone .
The EU country of Croatia is not yet a Schengen country .
After the closure of the Serbian and Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees have fled to Croatia in order to reach Western Europe from there .
500 people have come across the border with Tovarnik , reports the Croatian TV channel RTL .
Hungary had closed its border for refugees on the previous day .
New laws that entered into force on the same day make proper asylum procedures in Hungary virtually redundant .
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic said : ' You can go through and we are preparing for this opportunity ' .
These people are there , they are women , children and men who want to live and to achieve something .
However , it is people who did not want to live in Croatia .
In the morning , the Croatian police had taken up the first refugees on Serbia 's border with Croatia .
Most of them are media reports from Syria , Iran , and Afghanistan .
They came to the Serbian border town of Sid both by bus and taxi .
Immediately after their arrival , they would have tried to walk across the green border to Croatia .
On the Croatian Serb border , the refugees do not face border fences .
There are other threats to this : There are still sharp mines from the Yugoslav civil war in the 1990s .
Mine spacers should now quickly create a safe passage .
After Hungary , however , there are barely more refugees after the closure of the border .
On Tuesday , the police counted 366 dead people .
Shortly before departure on Monday , it was still 9380 .
The new Hungarian laws involve the overcoming and damage of the border fence as a crime .
In the Southern Hungarian border town of Szeged , 35 criminal proceedings were initiated .
The convicts risk prison sentences of up to five years and deportation from the country .
According to the immigration authority , on Tuesday a total of 94 asylum applications were received in the new transitons at the border , almost all - 93 - on the most important transition from Röszke .
Among the applicants , there are 13 families with young children and two older people .
On Wednesday morning , 40 refugees would have been detained there .
In practice , however , no one has any prospect of being granted asylum in Hungary .
In Hungary , Serbia is a `` safe third country . ''
The rejected asylum seekers should be deported .
In front of the `` transit zone '' in Röszke , only a few hundred refugees gathered together .
In Röszke , we are starting to clean up workers .
They collected the rubbish that tens of thousands of people had left on the streets in recent weeks .
A closed grid has been dismantled and one of the host camps in the border town has been rebuilt .
No one wanted to comment on the purpose of this restructuring .
After the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria is only a few refugees .
The country has also strengthened its border controls .
According to government figures , however , the 20,000 migrants still stayed in the country .
In Salzburg , about 1400 people are waiting for the further trip to Germany .
The train traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning by the German authorities .
Smaller groups of refugees met on foot in free leaving .
Mayor went to `` stranded '' over the border
`` We were busy after the bridge on Sunday , when there were suddenly ten people with rice offshoots at the entrance of the tent , '' said Mayor Alois Stadler .
Tourists , they wanted to take the train to Passau .
On Sunday , however , because of the flow of refugees , Germany was surprisingly able to stop rail traffic with Austria , it was for them in Wernstein , so Stadler , who immediately offered his help and drove the frames together with two other helpers and their cars across the border to the nearby Passau .
Prior to that , we have only once challenged the unexpected guests , with breakfast and drinks .
We have just said that we are bringing them to Passau by car .
`` This was of course for us , '' Stadler in the OÖN conversation .
They were very grateful .
A man did not have to hand over a generous donation - 100 euros for the fire brigade .
`` We were very pleased about this , '' Stadler said .
On Sunday evening in Wels , the stranded train passengers went from an ICE to a regional train in the direction of Passau , after the announcement that railway traffic was scheduled for Germany , but still try to cross the border .
The regional train , however , was parked on the Inn in front of the border in Wernstein .
In Wernstein the crossing of the border is generally high .
The bridge was organized by the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday , a day before a two-bridge race - organized by the Union Wernstein and Bavaria from Neukirchen .
The fact that Viktor Orbán is now sending more tens of thousands of people to us is a logical result of a hypocritical policy :
Instead of immediately assisting Röszke in the construction of structures that guarantee humanity , our Chancellor has brought the Hungarian Government 's attitude to the Dunstkreis of National Socialism in a highly official and public way .
The suffering of this policy is not just those Austrians who are now facing a chaotic situation in the border areas .
The people who have fled will also have to observe that the `` promised land , '' which she has invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp .
It will be a great challenge , given the continuing flow of refugees and the approaching winter , to create decent conditions for those who seek protection .
And it will be even greater peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad on the search for 35,000 winded quartz
Konrad has every hand to do with the provision of refugees .
Christian Konrad is aware that his word has weight .
The government has used the former powerful Raiffeisen broker to establish quarters for the thousands of refugees .
The chaos in Traiskirchen 's first reception centre has already got a grip on Konrad .
`` We do n't have a homeless in Traiskirchen , '' he told his first success .
The accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday was also without great fuss , said Konrad and praised the organizational `` master performance . ''
On the other hand , the Ministry of the Interior spoke of a `` crisis situation . ''
In total , Konrad expects a demand for 85,000 quarters in the year year .
In order to meet the number , there will have to be an even 35,000 accommodation in the next few weeks - 20,000 are to provide the countries , 15,000 of them .
If there are more refugees , we can do it .
`` But it is not a bottomless pit , '' said Konrad .
He has already had discussions with the capitals of the country .
They would have assured him that he would also create a part for the forthcoming refugees .
`` In Upper Austria it runs well , '' said Ferry Maier .
The former VP Mandatar supports Konrad .
Tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schönborn , to clarify how the Church will help .
The asylum coordinator also has great expectations in the ORF programme `` Helfen as we do . ''
On the platform , private individuals can easily offer accommodation .
There are also hotels that are empty in winter .
Yesterday , Konrad and Maier criticized the standards for accommodation as `` very high . ''
In emergency periods , it can not be possible for travel agents to comply with a certain amount of the towel holder or the size of the upper light .
For a temporary period , `` emergency standards '' should apply .
The fact that , unlike the Ministry of the Interior , he is more successful when it comes to accommodation , Konrad is responsible for his experience .
I am an older gentleman who does not say the truth on the face .
Persuasion is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Maier do not cost the republic as they declared .
They want to increase their workforce to three to four times .
The own travel arrangements have not yet been successful .
Konrad wanted to set up a container at St. Stephen 's Square as an office .
But there are apparently problems with authorisation .
Linz calls for better distribution
For the time being , there is no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings like Tips-Arena and Design Center for the accommodation of refugees planning the city of Linz .
This is not necessary at the moment , as those affected can be accommodated without these measures , says Mayor Klaus Luger -LRB- SP -RRB- .
In the case of an emergency , however , further sites should be checked for their suitability .
The government of the city is criticising the division of the refugees within the federal state .
Other districts must play their part here .
Seehofer : `` Limits are not sealed ''
In a longer telephone call with the Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seehofer -LRB- CSU -RRB- , District Governor Josef Pühringer -LRB- VP -RRB- on Monday raised the further approach to the question of refugees .
Seehofer has assured me that the German borders will not be sealed .
The transfer of refugees to the Federal Republic is still possible .
At the same time , however , there are the corresponding border controls .
There will be no special offers with refugees to Germany for the time being .
However , the protection seekers would be brought to Germany by regular trains .
Among the other EU member states , Pühringer called once again for greater solidarity on the issue of refugees .
The fact that Austria is now also introducing controls on its borders is a logical consequence of the actions of the Germans .
The Next Darkness is a Time of Time
The general restoration of the `` New Shipyard '' in the Linzer industrial line is officially completed .
In four of the six floors of the office and production building , the US S & T exchange-traded IT group is collected , the rest -LRB- 2700 square meters -RRB- is intended to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology sector .
`` In IT , the smart brains are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , '' says S & T-chef Hannes Niederhauser .
He could imagine to invest in Startup companies of the New Shipyard and later also to acquire them .
From the start , S & T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - Niederhauser 's promise : `` The next feature is only a matter of time . ''
€ 1.7 million has been invested by S & T , EUR 3.3 million from the Techcenter , which belongs to a third of the city of Linz , the Land of Upper Austria and the Federal Government -LRB- FFG -RRB- .
The building is leased to S & T and Techcenter for 60 years .
30 per cent of the 2700 square meters of space in the building have already been rented , for a further 40 percent .
Lia-Peroni actress opened the second business in the Arctic
In the new shop there are Furla handbags in the center .
In fact , Jutta wanted to raise a dog .
This project had to postpone the 49-year holder of LIA Peroni in the Taubenmarkt arcade : After all , it now has an increase in the form of another business entity .
In the Furla-Shop , in front of the shop , in which it sells bags , suitcases , shoes and clothing of different manufacturers , everything revolves around ladies ' handbags of the Furla brand , wallets are from 75 euros .
Larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 Euro .
Since yesterday the new shop is in operation .
Previously , it was rebuilt for several weeks .
`` I have long been considering whether I have to open a shop , '' he says .
One of the reasons for the decision was that the Furla producers , who are at home in Bologna , were also impressed by the idea of a site where only their handbags are sold .
`` We are the only ones in the wider Linz who sell this brand , '' says the mother of two daughters , who has their own Italian roots .
Her fashion interest has been put in the cradle of her mother .
I have the most if something is developed and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
Why so many women are in a hurry with the sight of a nice handbag , the woman can not answer with the latest security .
Perhaps it is because a beautiful bag appreciates every outfit .
The Brulljesmacher from Kallstadt
The ancestors of Donald trump came from a place whose inhabitants were called .
This feature also connects many with the billionaire who wants to become the US president .
Donald trump -LRB- 69 -RRB- is always good .
Whether he is hostile to xenophobia , journalists or knowledge gaps in international crisis politics - the candidate for the US presidential office is creating a powerful campaign .
And there is a good record of it .
This is also recorded in the city of Kallstadt , where the grandparents of the property billionaire come from .
The New Yorker with the Fconciliation is a lot of people in the Winzerdorf on the wine road .
Some of them are related to the 1200-single-resident location .
His grandfather came from Kallstadt in the Palatinate : Donald trump , here in campaign mode .
Simone Wendel made a film about trump .
And what do the villagers think about his goal of becoming the most powerful man in the world ?
`` I think they are somehow exciting , but are not so deeply impressed by their Kallstadter Art , '' says Simone Wendel .
The native Kallurban has shot an amusing documentary film about the town and its famous jumps , to which the Ketchup-family Heinz counts , in addition to trump .
Trump , who is not known for modesty , comes in `` Kings of Kallstadt '' -LRB- 2014 -RRB- , with the statement that he would certainly also be successful if he lived in Kallstadt .
To the king of the heart , he did not bring it there .
It is true that there is respect for the family 's performance , but it also tends to believe that trump `` is already a bit of a giant , '' Wendel says .
Coincidentally , the nickname `` The Brulljesmacher '' - `` The Brulljesmacher '' - is the adjective , she says .
So trump comes from the village of Angians .
The trump 's success story began in 1885 when a later grandfather emigrated and opened a restaurant for gold graves in the USA .
The foundation of the real estate company were first property acquisitions in New York .
But the life of the grandparents was not free from tragedy : Their desire to return to home in the long term failed in the Bavarian state , to which the Palatinate belonged at that time .
He did not include trump , because he would once be dismissed without permission , and the director of the Institute of Hunting History and folklore , Roland Paul , had explained to the start of the film .
Trump is the grandson of an `` illegal exodus . ''
This is in contrast to the sometimes markful statements of the offspring .
It had repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the US and called for the construction of a border wall in order to deter illegal immigrants .
`` So , like the polar , it is not so nice , '' says Hans-Joachim Bender , a distant relative trump -LRB- `` The Oma was a born trump , the opa was born Heinz '' -RRB- .
The retired winegrowers rather distance the Americans from `` he is always so arrogant . ''
Does he believe that trump comes ?
`` I ca n't imagine this , '' says the 72-year-old .
`` He has never cared about Kallstadt . ''
The guest house Veronika Schramm , like some members of Kallstadter , mentioned that a descendent of the Heinz family returned to the church organ during a visit , which was generally good .
`` I ca n't imagine this from the Donald , '' says the 68-year-old .
It would be better if he did not take the vote , because `` he has such radical views , I do not know whether that is good . ''
If those who , at the time of his grandfather in the US , would have been like him , `` he would never have arrived there . ''
`` There are more interesting topics than him , '' says Winzertochter Sarah Bühler .
And as President ?
`` My president is not there , '' she says .
And : `` The grapes are also ripe without the president trump . ''
Wendel 's film , which has long been interviewed for the trump , has seen 12 000 gigs , and in the US too , there is an interest .
The Upper Bavarian Municipality of Ramsau near Berchtesgaden is Germany 's first `` mountain climbing village . ''
From the hand of the Vice-President at the German Alpine Association , Ludwig Wucherpfennig , the 1800-one-person village in the Berchtesgaden National Park was awarded the award for gentle tourism on Wednesday .
In Austria there are already 20 `` mountain villages . ''
In the neighbouring country , the Alpine Association there is responsible for the award of the award .
A `` mountain climbing village '' may have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants .
At least one-fifth of its surface must be designated as a protected area .
Seven 's sunrise dominated the reviews , despite the attempts of Nine to assume the loss of leadership at the today show .
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson are coming to Canberra to report on the loss of the leadership of the liberals , but there have been no major shifts in the ratings for today .
The breakfast show of Nine was broadcast by the federal capital when Malcolm Turnbull made the fall of Tony Abbott .
The rival sunrise , with the moderators David Koch and Samantha Armytage , was in London as part of a one-week series of international television broadcasts , including Dubai , New York , Niagara Falls and Cancun .
This disadvantage of the company seemed to play no role for Australian TV viewers , as sunrise reached an average of 397,000 viewers in the five capitals , compared to today 339.000 .
Today achieved a slight increase in comparison with the ratings for Monday -LRB- 317,000 -RRB- and last Tuesday -LRB- 283,000 -RRB- , but its number remained behind the last Thursday -LRB- 343.000 -RRB- .
Today has closed the gap to sunrise in recent months .
In August , today reached an average of 318,000 compared to the 330.000 of sunrise .
At the beginning of the year , the distance was between 40,000 and 50,000 .
So far in September , sunrise stands at an average of 349,000 spectators at 314,000 in today .
This is the most interesting thing that happens every morning .
The winds of change affect these morning people more than Parliament !
Karl and Lisa are in order , thanks for the review !

The great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former serial number of Packed to the Rafters Erik Thomson .
The new drama about a recent father who decides to settle with his two children on the coast of New Zealand reached a very impressive number of 1.219 million viewers .
Critics had wondered whether Thomson could wear a hit show solo without the rafting star Rebecca Gibney .
The result of yesterday evening responded with a clear `` yes . ''
The X-Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.136 million viewers and easily beat The Block -LRB- 838000 -RRB- and TBL Families -LRB- 726.000 -RRB- .
Seven had mixed results in the evening of two of The Chase Australia .
The first half hour -LRB- 17 : 00 to 5.30 p.m. -RRB- the new quiz show , moderated by Andrew O 'Keefe revealed an average of 446,000 viewers .
The second half hour -LRB- 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 -RRB- jumped to 623.000 viewers - enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuires Hot-Seat -LRB- 613,000 -RRB- .
On Monday evening the first half hour of The Chase Australia reached 520,000 spectators and in the second half an hour , 720,000 .
Hot-eat on average 620,000 .
The decline in the quotas of The Chase Australia 's second evening will vote for confidence that Hot-Seat will ultimately prevail at 17 : 30 .
The Chase Australia is a replacement for Million Dollar Minute that did not manage to overtake the McGuires 's show .

The last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who is he going to vote ?
Secret reveals ? ...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows , Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may not knowingly have won the bachelor 's degree .
The woman , in which Sam Wood finally ends up in The bachelor , was shrouded in greatest secrecy .
And none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who received the last rose .
But when we checked with Sarah Mackay , Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows on the day prior to three , you may have given you an indication of who will be the winner .
Sam Wood closed his lips until the final on Thursday
All three women have lyrically omitted why Wood is the perfect man , naming his sense of humour , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner .
However , if the question is asked , `` If you do n't get Woods 's last Rose ? , '' your answers to the torch could be found , who won the heart of the bachelor 's degree .
Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski both quickly called Mackay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood had a simple relationship with each other from the first day .
`` From the moment I went to the house and -LRB- Sarahs -RRB- and Sams ' energies , I felt that they were quite compatible , and I thought about it throughout the show , '' said Jeavons-Fellows .
`` Sarah is on earth with both feet on the ground , it makes so much fun to be together with her , '' added Markoski .
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
They feel comfortable and comfortable .
Sarah Mackay believes that she and Sam Wood would be well equipped as a pair .
From their point of view , Mackay said that last week 's house visit made it clear that wood could be `` the One . ''
`` Once I saw him with my friends and the family , I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I am now fully adjusted to it , '' she said .
And when it was asked who wood should choose , if not , it was enigmatic .
`` I do n't know if I can say that , '' she said .
I love the remaining girls alike - it is a disdecided between Snezana and Lana .
The bachelor will be broadcast on Wednesday , 19 : 30 .

Jarryd Hayne had several options to start his NFS career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest in his move to the US - and there were many other teams who , after his impressive open training day , sent questions at the end of last year .
But Hayne chose San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula and it looks like a wise decision .
Some trainers would have banned Hayne for the rest of the game when he lost a free-for-all , as the Aussie-Rugby-Liga-convertit did at his first Punt-Return on Tuesday for the 20-3 victory against Minnesota .
But Tomsula trusted his husband and gave Hayne the next opportunity to an Punt-Return and also to the ongoing game of a violation of Reggie Bush .
Tomsula continued to show his true face in the changing booth after the game .
Instead of taking his rookies to the rest of the team through the mill , he encouraged them .
Tomsula also publicly strengthened Hayne 's press conference in his press conference .
The 49ers sports reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by Special Team Coordinator Thomas McGaughey to forget his patched catch and to take care of the next game .
Jarryd Hayne patched at a punt , restored in the first game district of Minnesota Vikings .
It was certainly not the start , the Hayne and his massive Australian entourage for his NFS debut .
Hayne left the pitch after the Fumble and later told the Australian radio duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 , that he could not imagine a worse start to his NFS career ,
`` That was a thing that now happens , you only care about the next game , and that 's it , '' Hayne said .
Hayne compared the Schnitzer with his original debut in 2007 , when a pass led to a try for Queensland in his own field .
Overall , it was a great experience for the 27-year olds .
Hayne posed for a photo with fans and holds an Australian flag after the game and sent it on his instagram .
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss the rights of gays
Mikhail Khodorkovsky , Russia 's richest man , was arrested on a Siberian roller with a force of arms .
Having openly challenged President Vladimir Putin , Khodorkovsky was condemned , his oil company seized Yukos and stopped his democratic efforts .
Because of the high numbers of refugees , Free voters are calling for the recruitment of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria .
`` We need at least 1000 additional teachers in order to save the schools from the collapse , '' said Aiwanger .
`` otherwise we will get distortions in the Bavarian education system . ''
The holiday group of outdoor voters meets in the Franconian community until Friday .
In fact , other major issues have been envisaged .
But the record number of refugees now dominates the free electoral meeting .
`` Of course the subject of asylum will be superseded by the Klausur , '' said Aiwanger .
Aiwanger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria , as it existed during the Yugoslav wars in the 1990s .
`` This does not go on , we have to look at the causes , '' said the Free voter leader .
Rejected asylum seekers want to postpone free voters as soon as possible .
That is why Aiwanger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum actions : `` We also need at least 50 new asylum judges , '' said Aiwanger .
The FW chairman criticised the fact that several federal states were not consistent : `` We needed uniform standards of the federal states throughout Germany . ''
`` Bavaria pushes forwards , others do not . ''
`` We must be more able to act . ''
But regional politics should not fall under the table in the Greater City .
A years of permanent burning remain on the agenda : Education policy .
For the new school year , cult minister Ludwig Spaenle -LRB- CSU -RRB- started the pilot attempt of `` middle stage plus '' at 47 Gymnasia , in which an extension of the upper secondary level is tested from three to four years - as a result , it takes nine years up to the Abitur .
But Aiwanger does not go far enough .
`` The G9 theme needs to be accelerated , '' said the FW CEO .
We call for freedom of choice for all Gymnastic people who want it .
Free travel at the G9 everywhere where it is desired .
This was the first time when Wall Street was to help Dax get into the game .
The German stock market , after a long journey , has closed a smooth and nervous trading course with profits .
Only in the afternoon a firm start of the US exchanges provided a clear direction , which in the end carried the Dax by 0.56 percent to 10 188,13 points upwards .
The MDax won 0.54 percent to 19 552.88 points .
Technological elastic TecDax rose by 1.03 percent to 1736,69 points .
The EuroStoxx 50 as the main index of the euro zone increased by 1.01 percent to 3207,60 points .
The trade hubs in London and Paris also made solid profits .
In the US , the Dow Jones index recently listed about 1 % in plus .
Many stock traders expect that the markets will appear in the US until the interest-rate decision in the US , and also the large drop in the futures on this Friday .
In the meantime , the discussion about the burden of the increase in nuclear power has pushed the shares of RWE to a record low , and has also left deep traces at Eon .
According to `` mirrors , '' the German energy groups may lack EUR 30 billion in reserves .
The Federal Government denied the figures mentioned in the press .
The shares of the two largest German energy companies recovered , but eventually lost 3.31 percent -LRB- RWE -RRB- and 6.15 percent -LRB- Eon -RRB- .
Infineon shares rose by an additional 3.22 percent at the Dax peak .
According to a trader , a positive report by the US investor magazine `` Barron 's '' led to the weekend .
As a result , investors are currently paying too little attention to German drivers .
In this context , investment in future-oriented wafer technologies and the focus on the auto market should pay off .
Car values were asked : Even in the traditionally weak summer of August , more cars were sold again than in the previous year , as the industry association ACEA announced at the start of the International Automotive Exhibition IAA in Frankfurt .

4 People killed after police police on demonstrators in Nepal
Four people , including a four-year-old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police shot the police into a mass of people who demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , said one official on Wednesday .
The violence erupted on Tuesday night in the district of Rupanstretched , about 175 miles west of the capital of Kathmandu .
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal , responsible district official , said that more than 1,000 demonstrators had gathered outside a police station , with some of you throwing stones and fire bombs .
Mr Dhakal said that the police used tear gas and then shot into the air before resorting to rubber missiles .
20 policemen and five civilians were injured , he said .
It was not clear immediately why the rubber shells used , which are known to be able to kill them , but which are traditionally used as a less lethal alternative , apparently produced such a high death rate .
The debate was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal 's southern levels , where members of the ethnic group of Madhesi say that new provinces formed under the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence .
There have also been protests in western Nepal from the ethnic group of Tharus who want their own state .
At least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been involved in violent conflicts since 10 .
August killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal , which has been centrally governed for centuries .
The work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the legislators accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
The legislators voted this week on certain clauses in the draft Constitution in Kathmandu , and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday .
Construction area in the city
The property at the Emder Jugendzentrum alte Post is to be built again .
The city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000-square metre area .
A mixture of trade , trade and housing is planned , but there are still no specific offers .
Emden - The city of Emden wants to market a plot of about 4000 square meters in direct vicinity to the Old Post Youth Centre .
Preparations for this are currently under way .
It is planned to use the terrain for a mixture of trade , trade and housing .
You are waiting for special offers , it is said by the city .
Which investor is in question is not yet clear .
Similarly , no contracts have been signed .
The city of Emden had already bought part of the land on the Ringstrasse and the Great Street , which was bought a few months ago , and the building on which it was built .
Project Hieve : Details are on the table
The planning of the holiday settlement on the Little Sea near Emden takes shape .
For the first time the investor presented plans for the project .
A large number of people are more worried - they fear the sale of their leisure life .
For months , negotiations had been negotiated , applauded , debated and drawn behind closed doors .
Now there are plans for a new holiday settlement on the small sea near Emden on the table .
The stakeholders , the medium sized Emder company `` System-Bau , '' presented its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the Emder Council Committee on Development .
Originally , this point was on the non-public part of the agenda .
Under the pressure of the project critics and the FDT Group , which accused the investor and the administration of secrecy , Ralf Behrends 's system management went to the offensive : `` We do not have an answer to all questions , '' he said before the members of the Council and more than 50 visitors .
But it is good to be able to deal with all the rumours now .
The EUR 10 to 12 million project has been under discussion for months .
Fierce reactions among sea owners who came to the meeting called for the pictures and new details of the desired hotel building .
Roberto Schulz , owner of the sea and a member of the Board of Directors of the Members of the Council of Representatives , Pro Hieve , said : `` This is a great event that will surprise all other people . ''
Moreover , like many other project critics , he fears that the intended size of the plant would greatly increase : `` there must be entire bus charges , so that it is expected , '' says Schulz .
However , what is happening on the very large grounds of the former restaurant is still open .
There is still no operator .
`` Well , we need to have a consistent concept , '' said Ralf Behrends .
Because this was still missing , the construction plans were still variable .
Twin offspring at Gorillas at Frankfurt Zoo
The Frankfurt Zoo is looking forward to seeing young people in his gorillas .
The 26-year-old Dian brought twins to the world yesterday .
Twin births are rare in gorillas .
The last in a German zoo is almost 50 years ago and was in Frankfurt in 1967 , it is from the zoo .
The sex of the newborn Gorilla twins is not yet fixed , as Mother Dian has so far kept her on the body .
First there was the `` picture . ''
NHC predicts 60 % chance for cyclone south of the Cape Verde Islands
The US National Hurricane Center said on Tuesday that a large low pressure system is about 350 miles -LRB- 560 miles -RRB- south of the most southern Cape Islands , which has a 60 % chance to become a tropical hurricane in the next 48 hours .
Another clearly defined low pressure system in the middle between the Cape Islands and the Small Antilles also has a 60-percent potential to form a tropical hurricane in the next two days , adding the weather experts based in Miami .
Google is starting to collect $ 11 million for refugees .
Google Inc -LRB- GOOGL - O -RRB- announced that a $ 11 million campaign for humanitarian organisations is to help thousands of refugees who have rolled over the European nations as they are fleeing from war-torn and impoverished countries .
Google has an unusually personal approach to the announcement of the spy call on his blog .
Instead of making a manager the announcement , Rita Masoud , a Google employee who fled with her family from Kabul when she was seven years old , wrote her personal experiences .
`` On our journey , many dark railway and coach trips , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , '' they wrote .
I was lucky .
But since the crisis in refugees and migrants has grown in Europe , many people like my family are looking desperately for help .
The donations go to four non-profit organizations that provide help for refugees and migrants : Doctors without borders , International Rescue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refugees .
Google said that the first global donations will be doubled to $ 11 million up to a value of $ 5.5 million .
Europe is facing its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four-year civil war in Syria , which has displaced more than 4 million people this year .
Many are also fleeing from the war-torn Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq , and Libya .

For slightly overweight diabetics , weight loss surgery can be helpful .
The benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes can take at least five years after a new study .
It is too early to say whether easily overweight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non-surgical treatments .
`` The mortality data need a long time to show something , '' said Dr. Robin Blackstone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote a key article about the new study in JAMA surgery .
Weight loss operations or obesity surgery , use various methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
They reduce hunger and limit the body 's own ability to absorb food .
Over the years , obesity operations for the treatment of type 2 diabetes have proved to be effective , but most studies have been carried out by people who are pathologically obese with a body mass index -LRB- BMI -RRB- of 35 or higher .
BMI , a certain measure of weight in terms of size , is considered to be normal between 18.5 and 24.9 .
A BMI of 25 or more shows that someone is overweight , and people with a BMI over 30 are considered to be obese .
You can calculate your BMI here : 1.usa.gov / 1D0ZqDv .
For the new study , the researchers from Taiwan 's Min-Sheng General Hospital used data that they have gathered in a study since 2007 , comparing two types of obesity surgery - stomach and stomach cancer - for medical treatment for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily overweight .
The average BMI among those suffering from this operation fell from 31 to 24.5 until the end of the fifth year in this study .
In the meantime , the BMI remained with those who received non-surgical diabetes treatments at the same time as 29 .
Among those who are subject to surgical intervention , 36 % of the diabetes disease was caused completely and partly by 28 % .
In the medical group , diabetes was compared with only one percent , and partly at only about 2 % .
In addition , the results of blood pressure , triglycerides and `` bad '' LDL cholesterol were `` generally better in the ' surgery ' group , '' the authors found out .
The researchers also monitored the patient blood level of haemoglobin A1c , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 % , researchers write .
After the operation , the average haemoglobin A1c level fell from around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
In the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at about 8 percent .
But this better `` glycemic control '' - as you will be reflected in the improved haemoglobin A1c level - did not reduce mortality in five years , said Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues .
The research team also compared average results in the two types of surgery .
In the fifth year , the Bypong surgeon group lost more weight in comparison to the guest rektomy group -LRB- 18.7 vs. 14.2 kg -RRB- , reached larger declines in the BMI -LRB- 7.4 against 5.1 -RRB- and haemoglobin A1c -LRB- 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % -RRB- and recorded more a complete resolution of diabetes -LRB- 46.9 % vs. 16.7 % -RRB- .
While the new study does not show a survival advantage of surgery after five years , there is evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden that leads operation to a longer life , says Blackstone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
In the Swedish study , it was in obese people , who were subject to an obesity operation , about 29 % less likely to die over the course of 15 years , compared to a group that tried more conventional methods .
Although the new study showed no advantage for the survival of the surgeon patients , Blackstone said it is reassuring for people with a BMI below 35 who are interested in the process .
`` This is the critical point of this study , because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BMI group , '' without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said .
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should begin to take weight seriously once the patient is with his BMI between 27 and 30 .
`` I think we are waiting too long until we get people to take this seriously , '' she said .
I think that once they have collected these genetic changes that have tied their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a reversal is really difficult .
Love story plays in the Hunsrück
It is an issue that is currently being increasingly taken into account in fiction : A young woman , unpopular at school , and unsightly , and after years the swarm of her youth is coming back , and she falls in love with her .
So also in the recently published novel `` We are not so '' by Luisa Binder .
In addition to the history of love , the novel is likely to be interesting for Hunsrück readers , as he plays in Langweiler and the surrounding towns .
The main professional author has grown up in Langweiler and is pleased that she has been able to place a literary monument to her home .
`` It is impossible that everyone can come to Europe '' - Dalai Lama - RT-News .
Europe can not accept all the refugees , said the Dalai Lama , and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East was true .
The Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to the violence in the home countries of the refugees .
The Dalai Lama raised the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis at the start of his ten-day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford , which is devoted to ethics studies .
He demanded that , in the given circumstances , the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of individual nations or even continents .
He also stressed that the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis was admirable , but the situation was not appropriate .
`` It is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , '' he said in his speech .
Although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria 's efforts to deal with the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
`` caring for several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you need to think about long-term solutions about how to create real peace and real development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , '' he said .
Ultimately , we need to think about how to reduce killing in their countries .
We must reduce the use of force .
`` The use of force has never solved these problems , '' he added .
The Dalai Lama raised the problem of violence and also commented on George Bush 's actions following the terrorist attack of 11 September , and found out that the violent reaction of the US led to a chain of uncontrollable events .
After 11 September , I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush , and I said to him that the way to solve this problem lies in non-violence .
`` I know his motives were good , but he imposed violence , and that caused unexpected consequences , '' said the Dalai Lama .
Children in the last 4 years of use in the last 4 years .
Poison control centres in the United States are reporting about a nearly 400 % increase in the number of children under the age of 12 who swallow strong alcoholic medicines , such as the Georgia Poison Center .
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez , director of the Georgia Poison Center , the cases of revenues from children under the age of 12 have increased from 3.266 in 2010 from 3.266 to 16.117 in 2014 .
`` Children increasingly come to these products and , unfortunately , a percentage of them go to the emergency , '' said Lopez CNN .
He said that some children are deliberately drinking disinfectants while some do it to impress their friends or have a sample of the social media .
Videos on YouTube show how young people drink disinfectants only because of a cheap experience .
Young people have allegedly mixed disinfectants with soft mouth water in order to get a harder drink .
Younger children can be attracted by attractive fragrances of disinfectants .
`` A child does not think that this is bad for it , '' said Lopez .
Many of the more attractive hand disinfectants are those that are parsed .
There are disinfectants with strawberry , grapes and orange jam , which are very attractive for children .
Hanging disinfectant agents contain between 45 and 95 % alcohol .
In the case of small children in particular , only a few syringes can lead to alcohol poisoning .
`` It is highly concentrated alcohol , '' said Dr. Stephen Thornton , medical director of the poison center at the hospital of the University of Kansas , Sender Fox 4 in Kansa City .
So , you would not allow yourself to be whisked , but people leave this hand disinfectant in the reach of children , and when children come to it , then it is a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol .
Nhaijah Russell , a six-year-old girl who had recently taken four syringes from the school after strawberry , was taken into care .
Their blood alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold , which is legally drunk in an adult , said Dr. Chris Ritchey , an emergency doctor who treated her in the Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta .
Nhaijah lured her words and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency .
Doctors watched them overnight in a separate hospital on signs of brain smoke , as the girl had fallen through the alcohol and encountered the head , said Ritchey .
`` This was very frightening , '' said Ortoria Scott , Nhaijahs Mother , CNN .
It could have been fatal to my child .
Lopez recommended parents and teachers to make use of non-alcoholic products or disinfectants and to store suspension equipment outside the reach of the child .
In addition to alcohol poisoning , some disinfectants were associated with deaths .
In 2013 , two women in Ontario women died after the swallowing of suspended infections , which contained a toxic , undeclared ingredient .
Health officials suspect that the product contained methanol , a lethal solution , rather than ethyl alcohol , which was listed as an active ingredient .
In January , three students of the fourth class in the state of New York planned to poison their `` mixed '' teachers by putting antibacterial products around the classroom , so a police report is reported .
The teacher is highly allergic to suspended disinfectant drugs and links them from her room .
The police regarded the sworn plan as `` hoax '' and drew disciplinary measures to the school authority .
Villingen-Schwenningen : Three vehicles
In the event of a accident at the crossroads between the North ring and the herds , a 33-year-old driver was easily injured in the event of an accident .
A 60-year-old lorry driver drove to the Querspange in the direction of the rotary industrial area and assumed too late that two preceding vehicles were stopped at the roundabout .
As a result , he jumped into the rear of an audio with his truck and sold this vehicle to an earlier Ford fiesta .
In the case of accident operators , the police shared material damage of about EUR 10 000 .
The 33-year-old Audi was no longer ready and had to be dropped .
Rumble kitchen : No Disharmonie at Celtic
Griffiths is shooting the talk of Disharmonie in Celtic Glasgow , Deila admits that the hoops are in bad shape , but that he is going to do it again .
Heart will fight SFA because of the charges of Neilson and will be wary of January new obligations that could destroy the unity of the caste .
Dons increase leadership over Celtic on five points
In the first half of the year , Aberdeen won a tight victory over Hamilton in Pittodrie , allowing the Dons to create a five-point gap between themselves and Celtic .
Griffiths discusses Disharmonie gossip
There are rumors of Disharmonie in Celtic Glasgow , which was spontaneously dismissed by Griffiths , which insisted that he and his team friends are not under increased control , as they are preparing for confrontation with the Dutch table leader .
I do n't think we feel under pressure , I think the players are looking forward to it .
The lack of title competition in Scottish football is boring Dutch - de Boer
The former Rangers middle field player and former national player of the Netherlands , Ronald de Boer , said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic , since there is no title rating with the Rangers .
De Boer , currently an ambassador for Ajax , said : `` In Holland they do n't show highlights of the Celtic games more and why ? ''
It is because the Rangers are not there .
People here are not just talking about the return of the Rangers .
You talk about the Old Firm .
They talk about both teams and that is what they are interested in .
There is a lot of tension in the Old-Firm games , and it is not just the people of Scotland who want to see these games .
I 'm going to turn things around , and I will listen to Deila .
RONNY Deila accepts that Celtic has to fight , but the Norwegian boss swear to turn things around .
After the defeat against Malmö and the following departure from the Champions League , the defeat was followed by a defeat against 10 men from Aberdeen , who are now at the top of the table with five points .
Deila said : `` Celtic had already had bad times , and we will come back . ''
Now we want to get there as soon as possible .
I know it is very frustrating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
We feel that this is the case - but we have to go further .
We really do need the support of Celtic , because that makes the players better .
Standing together is so important .
Warburton careful at January transfers
Despite his comments , only a few weeks ago , when he suggested that he made some January transfers , Rangers-Boss Mark Warburton is wary of signing new entrants and insists that he does not want to disturb the unity of the Ibrox Kader .
The former head of Brentford said : `` The January transfer window is very different from the summer windows . ''
The players who come in the summer have this advance time to integrate what you have seen with our own group this season .
The team is really good .
Sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need .
Celtic-target person Michu with return note ...
In the interview , Swansea storms Michu , with Celtic during the transfer period , indicated that he would be able to withdraw when his contract ends with the Swans .

Neilson remains what he said and insisting : `` I did n't question integrity , I did n't comment on performance . ''
Griffiths swears to avoid Tynecastle
The incorrigible Hibee was turned out after he allowed to sing a song with offensive texts about ex-Hearts , Rudi Skacel .
The incident occurred in a pub in the Roseburn area of Edinburgh in front of a Edinburgh Derby in Tynecastle in March 2014 .

I think that Stephen Thompson has faith in us .
We will bring the guys back to Trab , said Donnelly .
McInnes was happy to `` win Hamilton '' against Hamilton .
Derek McInnes admits that his team from Aberdeen had to fight desperately against Hamilton Accies to see a seventh consecutive league victory , which brought them a lead from five points before Celtic at the top of the table , thanks to Adam Rooney 's Elfmeter in the first half .
McInnes said : `` There is no team that has won everything , in poker games or leagues that have not won the games of this kind . ''
Unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while it is rising in the United Kingdom as a whole .
Unemployment in Scotland remained at 164,000 in the period from May to July , while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom as a whole rose to 1.82 million over the same period in the same period .
Scotland 's unemployment rate of 5.9 % stood above that of 5.5 % , as shown by the figures of the National Statistics Office -LRB- ons -RRB- .
In the meantime , employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,612,000 .
The employment rate for Scotland fell to 74.1 % over the period - a figure above the UK average of 73.5 % .
The Secretary of State for Scotland David Mundell commented on the latest figures and said : `` The long-term plan of the government has laid the groundwork for a stronger economy . ''
It is almost exactly a year since Scotland has made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
In these 12 months we have seen further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a reduction in unemployment .

Why I 'm witnessing an execution in Oklahoma
A little later , except in the case of a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death .
When it happens , and I hope that it does not happen , I will sit in a viewer gallery in the death chamber in the Oklahoma State Penitentiary when Richard Glossip is executed by the poison injection .
He has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
The invitation was made for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I voted .
When the day became closer , I began to fear .
So why should I do it ?
I voted because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
It would provide a unique perspective .
It is true that journalists are allowed to see executions in the United States and , since more applications are often available as places , a macabate lottery takes place to decide who will be elected .
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media places from 12 to five .
Those who are selected will observe it without emotion .
I can not do that .
I will sit beside Richard Glossips 's closest friend , with whom I have developed my own relationship with telephone numbers and a two-and-a-half hours visit over the months .
I like the guy .
We often laugh much when we speak .
The prison authorities say that I can not be a witness and a journalist , so I will not be allowed to take a notebook and a pen to record what I see .
I simply have to try to remember all the details .
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me of abandoning my impartiality on Twitter .
Here is the lesson .
Tell the story of the prisoner as he wants it and you get access .
I complained to her .
She admitted that she could `` formulate it better , '' but she still thinks it is wrong to do what I do .
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
He does not tell me what I have to write , and I would not do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he could remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
But he wants an international reporter to be there to write there .
When he dies , he thinks that public relations will help the movement against the death penalty .
Kim Bellware , a reporter of Huffington Post , will sit beside me .
If you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of podcasts I made .
I do not want to go into all the details again .
I can not safely say that Richard Glossip is innocent .
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of being a beneficiary .
But I believe that there is a strong probability that it is not guilty of murder .
I am sure that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
And from this perspective I will see him die .
I can not claim to be really objective .
There will be other reporters to whom you can apply .
What you will get from me is what it means to see a man dying an unnecessary death .
Man after wet police chase , talks about coming from the canning River
The canning Vale policeman remained dry when he moved the man from the canning River .
An attempt by a man of Perth to hang off the police was unsuccessful when he was in the shallow and marshy water , only a few meters away from a police officer who tried `` gently to persuade him to return to the shore . ''
The police of canning Vale was called on Tuesday for a home peace incident in Beckenham .
When they discovered the suspect , he tried to escape from them in the direction of canning River .
But he did not come too far .
`` He stood in the water and said I did not come out , come and Hol me , '' said Senior Shandell Castledine .
Constable Lachlan Perhavec was not too excited to make his uniform wet , so he turned a more reliable tactic - `` A good policeman negotiates . ''
`` Sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , '' said Senior actress Castledine .
Championship soccer player Ben cousins offers an unforgettable experience .
In 2006 , cousins left his car in the ditch to escape an alcohol control and then tried to swim over the Swan River .
His efforts were fruitless , but inspired locals to the humorous planning of a Ben Cousins-Biathlon .
Peter Moody claims that stewards tried to spy him out and threatened to stop racing
Peter Moody claims that stewards from Racing Victoria have tried to install a spy in his stables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
He was aimed at the stewards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and claimed that they conducted a personal campaign against him with the late scratching of Lady Tatai because of a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
Moody 's Fairfax Media said that he has always tried to do what is best for racing racing and that he found himself under difficult conditions when it came to the positive cobalt test at Lidaris , which he can not explain .
He refused 18 months ago because of the charges of espionage and did not want it to `` look like too high hanging grapes . ''
`` I had to say nothing about it , and I have sat on it for a long time , but sometimes you are so frustrated that everything comes out , '' Moody 's said .
You know that it went on .
Sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I have said .
I will go to home tonight and sleep well .
I want to walk around and I would like my owners to think that I am trying to do my best for them .
If you start to think I do not , then I should not be more coach .
I have to consider what I do with my license .
Previously , Moody 's had the bomb in an interview with racing.com , that the integrity department had tried to spy out its stall .
`` Before eighteen months , Terry Bailey , Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - whom I will name when I am asked - and offered him employment in my stables to deliver information about what I do within my stables , '' said Moody on Racing.com.
They seem to believe that I am a fraudster .
If that is the case , they should surely touch on their nases , because they have failed in trying to grasp me .
Robert Roulette , Chairman of the RVL , David Moodie , President-in-Office of the RVL and Bernard Saundry , current CEO of the RVL , were aware of this at the time and are still present .
Should I take the view that it is personal ?
Did the RVL behave in a cowardly way and perhaps makes people responsible for what is going on in the industry outside of trainers ?
Am I bad for the industry ?
Am I so bad for the industry ?
Maybe the people outside think that I am it .
Perhaps they have to take my licence and break me , and I have no doubt that what I am saying will now allow them to reflect on them .
But I have now arrived at the point on which I do not care , and that makes me sad .
That makes me really sad .
I will put the pressure on them and urge them to take a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
The frustration levels of the trainer were built with the long-running cobalt examination at Lidari , and late scratching led him to say that he `` could throw his license across the table . ''
Moody , best known by his preparation of the unsettled master Black Caviar , called the racing treatment rule `` ridiculous '' after a pack of mud or clay had been applied to the horse mines , which violated the rules .
It is against the rules of racing sport .
I have to assume full responsibility for this , he said .
One of my staff mistakenly applied mud to the leg .
It could have been the same last night .
It could have been the whole day yesterday , which was the case .
But it also was on the day of the race .
Moody could face a three-month disqualification for the treatment of the pack on the day of race , and a study of this issue has been opened .
It is a joke .
People who set up these rules do not know about the horse .
`` We all see that we need rules , but here we have gone too far , '' said Moody 's .
A Man after the Drivers of the Drivers
At the weekend , the police arrested a man after a collision with a cyclist and subsequent driver in Cobram .
The cyclist was delivered with the helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries , after he was hit by a car on Saturday morning on the MurrayValley motorway .
The police said that the driver went on , without stopping to help the injured driver .
On Monday , a 50 year old man from Nathalia of the police arrived in Shepparton .
He is expected to be indicted for driver evasion and reduced assistance and for other traffic offences .
The cyclist , a 40-year-old man from Cobram remains in the hospital and is in a stable condition .
Melbourne-Storm trainer Craig Bellamy beats rivals because of claims to ring fighting
Melbourne-Storm trainer Craig Bellamy has described his player 's `` Agenda Level '' by two Premier League favourites of the NRL .
Sydney Rooster trainer Trent Robinson said that the referees allowed the storm players `` wrestling '' with his team during the high storm race in the qualifying finals in Sydney on Friday evening .
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a barely veiled remark about the Storm team after his team reached the Final-Sieg against North Queensland cowboys on Saturday night , calling the game a `` model example '' of the Rugby League and said that the two from Queensland are not `` too good '' in the rings .
Bellamy defended the tail of his team and said that they were only concentrated on their `` contact . ''
Bellamy added that the criticism of two leading coaches to his team was confident , as it meant that they were afraid to be beaten by the story team .
`` This appears again and again - I did n't hear that Trent Robinson talked about wrestling when they beat us 24 : 2 , '' said Bellamy on Wednesday .
I can guarantee that throughout the year we have not changed our defensive system or techniques , but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tackles in a real way , and that is the turn of the trend .
Trent has been there for three years , and he obviously has a great team to train , so he is probably not used to lose , so it was a bit of a shock for him .
It is already funny , as it appears at this time of the year .
Bellamy has attacked Bennett 's idea of `` exciting football '' and reminded his mentor that Bennett St George Illawarra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with `` boring '' football .
Wayne speaks of exciting football .
He compared his game on Saturday evening with us on Friday evening and how exciting her game was , said Bellamy .
I remember that in 2010 St George was criticized as a boring team , and Wayne said that he was going to take care of it .
But now he has a team that can play and which we see as exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
This is the ball you want to play when you have this kind of player .
He made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his way of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt , so that they can play like these .
I have greater confidence because they say these things , because they are a little concerned to play against us .
Six weeks ago they did n't think of us when it came to the big games .
Bellamy also pointed out that the game Storm against Rooster achieved a higher result than the game of Broncos against cowboys .
The game of the Broncos was probably a good game , I have not seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
Our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts at our game , but is this an exciting game ?
Or are breaks and no points of tension ?
For me , it is the game plans .
When you mention it , it means that we will meet them in a period of time .
The Storm team is free this weekend , as they won the right to receive either North Queensland cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks in the pre-finals in the AAMI Park next Saturday .
Serbia with $ 200,000 on drugs deposit
A man who may face a life sentence because of his attempt to come into the possession of 40 kilograms of cocaine smuggled to Queensland has been released for a deposit of $ 200,000 .
Marko Maksimovic , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Solay , which came from South America via Vanuatu and put it in Coomera in August .
Maksimovic was watched as he met his colleagues in the Marina in the course of the morning and later at Café Coomera Roadhouse , where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota echo .
Despite a possible life-length penalty for trying to possess a commercial quantity of cocaine , the lawyer of Maksimovic argued that there is no evidence that he tried to possess the whole lot and that he could have been in the cafe for a harmless reason .
The judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flanagan , was concerned about the threat of flight to Maksimovic .
He has clear relations with Serbia .
He often travels to Serbia , he explained the court on Wednesday .
In the criminal matter , he accused the police about his whereabouts .
Maksimovics mother and stepfather had offered a deposit of $ 200,000 for security together to achieve his release .
`` After reading the offensive statements of the two people , it is clear that the circulation of a security of $ 200,000 is a real financial burden , '' said Judge Flanagan .
But that alone will not be enough to prevent him from appearing , he warned .
Maksimovic was released on bail , under the conditions that he is issuing his Australian and Serbian pass , reporting to the police every day and standing at a starting block of 18 : 00-06 : 00 .
Accident on A5 in Karlsruhe : Management House
In the case of a road accident with three trucks on the highway 5 near Karlsruhe , a lorry driver has been seriously injured on Tuesday evening .
Two of the three lorries involved had put a brake on a permanent place in the direction of Basel .
The third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to depart at the last moment to the left , as the police pointed out .
The driving house of the accident causing the accident was completely different .
The driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
The A5 between Bruchsal and Karlovy Vary was completely closed for more than six hours until 2 p.m.
A loss of 122,000 euros was done .
Stevan Hogg used phone of girls to draw paedophiles to send pictures
A paedophile used the phone of a 11 year-old girl to request images of child abuse .
Stevan Hogg took the phone from the girl when he slept , logged into an online messaging service , from which he received a number of indecent pictures of children sent to him by another user .
The girl woke later and discovered that the phone lacked and found it in the hand of the sleeping Hogg .
She saw it , found the confusing messages and immediately alerted her mother .
The police took care and saw the five images , then analyzed computers that were found under the address and discovered `` relevant '' web search , which used terms for search for indecent images of children .
Hogg then claimed to the officials that he did it , as it would lead to `` paedophiles on the Internet '' and then `` decided to be a policeman to scare them . ''
The lawyer , Eilidh Robertson , said to the Dundee Sheriff Court : He said it is an addiction - he is addicted to scare people .
He admitted that searches on the computer were carried out by him , but said that it happened because he wanted to be a policeman to scare paedophiles .
He was asked for his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send more photos .
He said that he did to attract them .
He said he was sick when he drinks , and said that he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder .
Ms Robertson added : When the girl found the news on the phone , she called her mother and was on a quote and on the wine .
She then also saw the indecent pictures on the phone and confronted the accused with it .
The girl was interviewed and said that the accused computer and Playstation used to speak with girls who looked much younger than he was .
Hogg , 23 , Ward Road , Dundee , declared that , in the sense of the indictment , indecent pictures of children on 14 June last year , violated the conditions on 25 January of this year and did not appear before the courts for a hearing on 24 March of this year .
Defence lawyer Gregor Sim asked that Hogg did not appear on the register of sexual offenders , as it could be argued that `` no significant sexual element '' could be found in his crime .
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael denied the verdict until October to receive background reports on social work .
Hogg was granted bail in this case , but was held in custody because of hearings to others .
It was included in the register of sexual offenders before the date of judgment .
Smugglers depart on small border crossings with Germany
More and more refugees are taken up on the German-Austrian border away from the large control points .
For fear of discovery and arrest , many smugglers have been able to increase the number of people at smaller border crossings
On the Austrian side , said a spokesman for the Federal Police .
Along the border river Inn , since Tuesday , more than 1000 refugees have been picked up in the districts of Passau and Rottal-Inn .
They were on foot via bridges and dams on the German side .
There they are received by federal police and forwarded to the registration .
At Munich 's main train station , compared to the start of the week on Wednesday , significantly more refugees met on Wednesday .
Some 700 people have arrived in the capital by 8 : 00 , a speaker in the morning said .
After the reintroduction of controls at the German-Austrian border , on Tuesday 1759 refugees reached the city .
Stuttgart : `` Henry '' from tropical storm in the southwest
Meteorologists warn of storms in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon .
Due to a low pressure area over Western Europe , warm sea air currently flows into the country , divided by the German weather system -LRB- DWD -RRB- in Stuttgart .
In the last few days , Bermuda islands were drawn by the Bermuda Islands via the Atlantic Ocean .
Violent storms and thunderstorms are expected , especially in Baden .
According to DWD , until Thursday morning in the Black Forest , on the Swabian Alb and the Bodensee Circle , there is a total of between 60 and 90 kilometres per hour .
On Friday you can see the sun again .
The masses are the ones : Every two years , the cars at the IAA are showing their innovations .
In 2015 , there is a lot of movement in the compact cars , which are currently selling particularly well .
Cars from the compact class are in particular demand : About 28.1 percent of the new registrations were in this segment in August alone .
This is also reflected in the IAA -LRB- audience Stage 17 - September 27 -RRB- .
Between all the futuristic concept vehicles and new top class and luxury cars , this year 's many new compact models will be presented .
One of the biggest premieres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will be at the dealers in the autumn .
`` The Astra is an extremely important model for us , '' said Opel chairman Karl-Thomas Neumann at the fair .
It belongs to the core of the brand .
If the volume model is well sold , the new Astra will not be much more expensive .
Opel offers an entry below the biggest competitor VW Golf , which starts at EUR 17 650 .
The current Astra costs € 16 990 .
The Astra is available with a new 1,4litre engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
In addition , the Hesse is offering further diesel and petrol engines from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 PS , of which three cylinder systems also count for the first time .
Unlike the most important competitor VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is only as a fifth .
The second version will follow in the spring of the Kombi , which can also be seen at the IAA .
And what will be done in addition to the Astra at the IAA still on new compact cars ?
Renault Mégane : Renault is sending the fourth generation of the Astra-rival Mégane to the race .
At the fair , the Mégane can be seen exclusively as a fifth in a conventional and accentuated sporty GT version .
He comes to trade at the beginning of next year , and then as a combi .
Infiniti : Infiniti Q30 is completely new in the segment .
The Nissan stacker wants to find its position in the strongly growing segment with the new model .
With its curved lines , the compact Infiniti fits fully into the design line of the brand .
The base model will be a petrol engine with a capacity of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
The offer includes a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Suzuki Baleno : New in the segment is also the Suzuki Baleno , who celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
The model is offered with petrol engines , including a newly developed 1 litre turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp .
The maximum torque is 170 Newton meters -LRB- NM -RRB- according to the manufacturer 's specifications .
The start of the Baleno in Europe is in the spring of 2016 .
DS 4 : Not quite new , but completely renewed is the compact classic model DS 4 , which can be seen at the IAA .
On the outside side , the designers of the noble Citroën-Ableger placed their hand on the front side : Here the cool grill was redrawn and the changed headlights were fitted with LED technology .
In the interior , the infotainment system has been modernised , the number of buttons is reduced by a touch screen and , for the first time , integrates Apple Carplay .
In addition , at the IAA in the compact class , there are a number of revisions and new variants such as the boom Mercedes A-class or the Peugeot 308 GTI .
JVA Berlin-Tegel : Five square meters of cell are human .
The Federal Constitutional Court has given a legal status to an exile prison of the Law enforcement agency Tegel , which was housed in a small cell for months .
Because of the violation of their human dignity , prisoners have a fundamental right to financial compensation when they are placed in too small cells .
This was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday .
According to the judges , the judges can even hope for money even if they had been locked up for a few days in the overly narrow spaces -LRB- Ace . : 1 BVR 1127 / 14 -RRB- .
He was born in Karlsruhe , Germany , with his constitutional certificate in Karlsruhe : Between June and November 2009 , he was in a single cell with about five square meters of floor space ; the toilet was not separated in space .
After that , the man who , according to his lawyer , has now been left again , had been moved to a larger cell .
His position in charge of the conditions of detention against the country of Berlin failed .
However , the constitutional magistrates set up the judgment of the Berlin Chamber Court and rejected the case for further examination .
They are in violation of the dignity of the man .
Chamber Court now decides on the amount of compensation .
Even though , for legal reasons of the period in question , only a few days of detention for compensation are significant , a compensation claim was made , it was said .
Otherwise , there would be `` a failure to protect the rights of the individual . ''
The Chamber Court must now clarify the level of compensation .
In the past , the constitutional magistrates have often strengthened the rights of prisoners .
In April , they only made compensation for a prisoner because he was naked in a cell .
According to a decision of 2011 , the multiple assignment of a cell without a separate toilet is also unworthy of humanity .
In addition , Karlsruhe confirmed the Constitutional Court of Berlin on Wednesday , which confirmed a prisoner in a parallel case in November 2009 .
The then plaintiff was in a similar cell in a similar cell in a similar cell for three months over three months , as in the Karlsruhe case .
The Berlin prisons have been in the headlines over the last few weeks because of the lack of staff .
Prisoners are therefore always trapped in 23 hours , and the aggressiveness is increasing , even in the face of the tense situation .
According to the legal office , 21 places in Tegel will not be occupied due to the shortage of young people , and 19 will disappear in 2016 .
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : `` We are creating it . ''
The immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept it .
What happens in Germany ?
Some 800 000 asylum seekers will come to Germany after forecasts of the Federal Ministry of the Interior this year , according to Vice-Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel -LRB- SPD -RRB- , and Germany is even able to accommodate one million refugees .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel -LRB- CDU -RRB- demonstrated his determination in the face of the unusual challenge : `` I say again and again : We can do it , and we are creating it . ''
What Germany deserves is the following overview .
According to different forecasts , between 350000 -LRB- estimate of the Federal Ministry of Economics -RRB- and 400000 -LRB- estimate of the Pestel Institute -RRB- are needed annually for the next five years .
This is almost double the amount built so far -LRB- 250000 homes -RRB- .
However , the lack of housing is dramatic but , above all , in the case of affordable rental objects : Every year , 60 000 to 80 000 social flats fall out of the rental price , and these particularly cheap housing will also apply for refugees .
Federal Minister Barbara Hendricks -LRB- SPD -RRB- therefore wants to double the promotion , from now on 518 million to EUR 1 billion .
From the point of view of the plague Institute , 80 000 social housing would have to be created each year , and the federal government would have to invest in an increase of 6.4 billion per year .
Scientists and the Federal Minister for Development agree that there must also be more tax benefits for investment in housing .
According to estimates of the Institute for Employment Research and Research , it is estimated that 55 % of the people who fled in Germany can work in the long term .
But the refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked about their qualifications to help them start by criticising Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education at the Bertelsmann Foundation .
For the integration of refugees , however , it is crucial that they work in Germany .
Work is the key to social contacts , for appreciation in the host society , but also for the self-esteem of immigrants , says migration researcher , Dietrich Thränhardt .
In Germany , according to Thränhardt , there has been a political shift : From the ban on employment for refugees for the recognition of work .
While there was a working ban on asylum seekers of up to five years , it was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the residence requirement that limits asylum seekers to a residence .
In society - even because of the shortage of skilled workers - the majority of people have accepted the view that refugees should be allowed to access the labour market more quickly .
A major obstacle to access to the labour market is a lack of German knowledge .
So far , there is still no sufficient offer of general and professional language courses .
Research also shows that jobs are most often mediated by personal contacts .
The construction of networks is therefore , in the view of Thränhardt , the premier way to work integration .
The Berlin school administration has found that only a few winged parents give their children to the kitas , an estimated ten to 15 percent : `` For uprooted parents , it is very important to keep the family together , '' says Ilja Koschembar , spokesman for youth and family in the Berlin Senate administration .
In order to convince the family of the benefits of Kita , the administration distributes handpapers in different languages .
If the need for young people is to rise sharply , the Berlin Senate would try to increase training capacity - for example , by allowing more specialist schools .
In the countries , students are prepared for lessons without a degree of English in welcome classes .
However , they are not always taught by fully trained teachers and teachers , but , as in Berlin , they are also taught by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language .
There is no lack of them , says Beate Stoffers of the Berlin school administration .
The German Studentenwerk estimates that about 20 % of the refugees want to study in Germany .
In principle , no federal state prohibits asylum seekers or patient studies - the only exception was Berlin , Innensenator Frank Henkel -LRB- CDU -RRB- has now abandoned his attitude .
Student refugees could facilitate access to the university .
After all , refugees with a residence permit or tolerance do not receive benefits after the law on asylum seekers when they begin their studies .
In principle , the latter will not have a bafög , as they do not fall within the circle of people who are eligible .
Refugees have had to live in Germany for four years in order to be Bafög-justified , from 1 January 2016 , this margin is reduced to 15 months .
However , this funding gap must also be closed , Steffen Krach , Berlin 's State Secretary for Science , and the German Studentenwerk .
Students should immediately be given Bafög .
Islam will play a more important role in the future , because many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of its identity .
The state should gradually give the same rights to Islam as they have the churches , and the existing state church right to a new state state relationship develops .
It is also important to establish an Islamic welfare association that is professionally concerned with the newcomers .
Rights also belong to the right .
For example , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contacts and be willing to cooperate with the state in many areas and give it certain means of control .
This includes a willingness to act against religious fundamentalism .
Aiman Mazyek , Chairman of the National Council of Nations , said on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be added to Germany .
Those who wanted to carry out such conflicts in Germany `` have immediately their right to be here , in Germany , '' he said in Bavarian broadcasting .
He proposed to translate the Basic Law into Arabic .
In the future , integration will be a major issue for society as a whole .
This will also have to change the majority society , and the reduction of discrimination and racism will become more pressing .
As a result of European decisions , Germany has had an anti-discrimination office and a general equality law for a few decades .
But it learns very slowly , as shown by the NSU murder series , in which the police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motive .
Equal chances for everyone : What migrant organisations and non-white Germans have been calling for for a long time , and international agreements such as the anti-racism convention , Germany , must become a reality in the next few years if the country is to remain peaceful and its new citizens should take advantage of their opportunities - for the benefit of all .
Generally , Germany is able to provide medical services to the expected refugees , says Medical President Frank Ulrich Montgomery .
`` With regard to man- power and capacity , we create that , '' he said to the day mirror .
However , extra money must be invested in the system .
In order to avoid bottlenecks , Montgomery calls to hand health cards to all descendants right at the time of registration .
Services provided could be settled with the Federal Länder later .
And , in the long term , it is highly questionable to exclude so many people with the limited catalogue of services that the law on asylum seekers are considering .
Otherwise , doctors will primarily create the language barriers .
So far , Berlin-based health scientist Thea Borde has shown that migrants are worse informed about their diseases than other patients .
Not only in clinics , but also in medical practices , interpreting costs would have to be carried out , it calls for them .
However , a lot of refugees would already have been helped with more general medical contact points in the emergency ambulance posts .
And with a different diagnostic perspective .
In refugee camps , for example , there are much more untreated disabilities , and young people are talking about HIV education .
German doctors , however , would be aware of their training , says Montgomery , with some of the other pictures of the disease .
`` parasite or tuberculosis is not so difficult to recognize , '' and with regard to the shortage of doctors , the refugees may even have relief in sight .
The Syrians would have a sophisticated education system , a number of refugees , even doctors .
In order to be able to practice , however , they would have to prove their qualifications and perhaps to take tests again .
At least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill , according to the estimates of the German Chamber of Cancer Therapy -LRB- BPtK -RRB- : Most of them suffer from a post-traumatic stress disorder or depression .
Particularly vulnerable are refugee children , explains Dietrich Munz , president of BPtK .
A recently published study of the Tu Munich shows that every fifth Syrian refugee child is traumatized in Germany .
Those who are sick of a post-traumatic stress disorder suffer , among other things , on so-called flashbacks with breathing , dizziness , heart rushes and death fear .
Other symptoms are sleep and concentration disorders , strong fragility and emotional deafness .
To prevent the symptoms from being chronic , early treatment was needed , declared Munz .
So far , however , only 4 % of the mentally ill refugees receive psychotherapy .
While mentally ill asylum seekers can make a request for psychotherapy in the social offices , the treatment usually takes several months .
Moreover , in the case of social experts , specialist workers or doctors who are not trained for mental disorders would decide whether a therapy is necessary or not .
This often leads to misjudgments , says Munz .
Manege invites you to dream
With the new staging of `` passion '' the Circus Probst draws on the traditions of circus art .
The goal is to captivate every age group with fascinating acrobatics , animal surfers and unique entertainment .
Now the circus invites you into the manege on the brick wall to dream .
`` Our passion is the circus . ''
`` I can not imagine living without my circus family , '' says Stephanie Probst , Animal Teacher and Junior Chair .
`` passion '' - with this motto is the current stage of production .
For more than 33 years , the circus has been in the hands of the family trial .
In other words , the family 's gift lies in the blood .
`` It is important to get people away from their everyday life and take them into a completely different world for two hours , '' says the 27-year-old June Secretary .
`` First cocktail with a cosmopolitan flair , '' Director Reinhard Probst calls his concept .
50 cities on the almost 3 000 kilometres of tour can now experience this flair .
The program of the circus convinces with talented artists from all over the world .
Awarded at the international circus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian Stoliarov Clown Family captivates the audience with wit and charm .
The Castillo Brothers also understand their crafts .
With the heroes of the silent film , the Cuban duo wants to absorb it .
Lightness and agility - these words identify themselves .
Her humorous art at the mast is supposed to conquer women 's hearts in the storm .
Apart from numerous salmon salads , the acrobatics of the circus also fascinate us with a sense of sensitivity and strength .
Use the single wheel to balance on a ball ?
There is no problem for He 's yuan .
Snake humans fascinate and scare at the same time .
Wang Lin from China is familiar with the oldest form of acrobatics as little others and is fascinated by its flexibility .
60 employees from 12 nations offer variety in every respect .
`` The animals belong to our family , '' says Stephanies Mother , Brigitte Probst .
Abuses in the attitude of circus animals are all too often the subject of various animal welfare organisations .
Stephanie Probst also makes a statement : `` It is not good for our animals , but it 's not good for us . ''
About 80 animals from five different continents enjoy every string unit .
The `` four-legged artists , '' as they are affectionately called , will be taken from the eyes of the eyes .
We want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
If the animal does not feel , it will not be in the manege either .
In other words , the most important thing is to care for the animals .
Especially for her zebroid Jumbo , a mixture of a Shetland and a zebra tree , the family is proud of it .
The two animals have lived together for eight years in a walk and nothing has happened .
`` But then , suddenly , our little Jumbo was there , '' says Brigitte Probst .
The zebroid is not yet ready for the manege , but it is the unique mascot of the Circus Probst .
So every visitor will be able to do something .
`` One is sure , '' says Stephanie Probst : `` Egal whether there are five or 1 200 viewers , we always give our best and are with all our heart . ''
From 17 to 20 September , the Circus Probst invites you to his ideas every day at 17 and 20 .
On Sunday the program starts at 11 : 00 pm .
Thursday is family day , and for the idea at 5 p.m. the prices are reduced .
In addition , the animal show is open every day from 10 am to 6 pm .
Zimbabwe 's Robert Mugabe makes the wrong speech in Parliament
Mr Mugabe , Africa 's oldest leader , fell from a podium at the beginning of the year .
He remained unlucky , but the video of the case spread quickly through the social media .
The opening of Parliament was also tainted by allegations by Members of the opposition that they would have received anonymous death threats and that they were warned against supporting Mr Mugabe 's speech .
Last month , she denounced it and interrupted him during his speech on the situation of the nation in Parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
The Speaker of the Movement for Democratic Change -LRB- Movement for Democratic Change - MDC -RRB- Innocent Gonese said that seven opposition politicians received SMS messages on their mobile phones , which warned them to disrupt Mugabe 's speech .
`` The news comes from a number that does not appear , but it has the title ' death , '' he told journalists about Mugabe 's speech .
It warns the parliamentary members who have been affected , that immunity is ending in Parliament , and as soon as they leave Parliament , their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective .
The chief speaker said that the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai is `` concerned '' about the dangers to politicians .
Hewlett-Packard will reduce up to 30,000 jobs .
Hewlett-Packard is expected to end 25,000 to 30,000 jobs within the framework of restructuring and saving efforts on the company 's services .
Later this year , HP will split into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its rapidly growing corporate hardware and service activities .
The expected job losses leads to a burden of more than $ 2.7 billion from the fourth quarter , HP said in a statement .
`` These restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett-Packard Enterprise , '' said Meg Whitman , HP , and Chief Executive , who are supposed to lead the unit after separation .
`` Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than it is HP today , and we have a broad and in-depth portfolio of shops that support companies in the transition to a new style of business , '' said Whitman .
As an independent company , we are better placed than ever to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion in annual sales , and `` will be focused on the delivery of unfulfilled , integrated technology solutions for companies , '' said a statement by the company .
It divides a company that was founded in the 1930 s by the graduates of Stanford University Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to produce electrical installations and their Palo Alto garage was called `` the birthplace of Silicon Valley . ''
HP has gone through a massive restructuring to cope with the shift from traditional PCs to mobile devices .
The measure of HP , the world 's second-largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US tech companies , is the latest in this field , which is based on the conviction that closely focused companies deliver better performance .
FC Arsenal-captain Mikel Arteta says that team mates must stand against Dynamo Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wilshere .
Wenger emphasized in relation to Wilshere that it was only September , and if his rehabilitation goes on plan , there is no reason why he can not play again before Christmas .
This optimistic scenario already means that Wilshere will surely miss at least the next four games for England and , in the face of his story , his participation in the European Championship is certainly still uncertain next summer .
The great shame on this current problem is that Wilshere strongly ended the last season after a separate ankle injury and then returned to his old swing during the pre-season season .
`` This kind of violation does not threaten the career , '' said Wenger .
It is a bone that did not heal well .
This is not a major issue .
This was just an accident .
It was not in contact with his nobles or with the injuries he had before .
This may be true from a purely medical perspective , but as Wenger also recognised , there is the associated danger of further injury , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
It also develops an unpleasant pattern .
The investigation by Premier Independents Ltd has recorded 23 different diseases of Wilshere since his debut six years ago .
He also played in only 65 league games over the last five seasons .
The most common picture for Arsenal is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs in six of eight game times since 2007 / 08 , which have recorded the most days of injury .
Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle , but Arsenal believes that an improvement in the injury rate will continue during the last season .
`` Sometimes if you come back from a violation , you have a due period , a time when you need to strengthen your body and gain strength , '' said Wenger .
Jack is young enough to overcome it .
I hope his body stabilizes , I am confident that he will do it and he will undergo a career of the kind he deserves .
Arsenal begins its Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Dinamo Zagreb in front of the matches against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday , and Wenger launches a rotation within the team .
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not travelled to Croatia , meaning that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta should start .
Wenger can also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott .
`` I 'm trying to keep the balance and the players who need to have a small pause , '' said Wenger .
Although Arsenal is clear favorites , Group F , the Maksifi stadium in Zagreb is one of the playgrounds with the greatest effect of intimidation in Europe .
Dynamo is also vulnerable to 41 games after the `` invincible '' campaign was started in the last season .
The stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , measured on the Richter scale 3.2 .
This year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
Wenger believes that Arsenal has drawn the lesson from the previous season with the Champions League 's surrender to Monaco and remains driven by the distant hope that his management will lead the club to its first European triumph .
`` This drive is immense , '' said Wenger .
It has never worked in the case of Arsenal .
We were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I am long enough to be realistic .
We are ambitious , but we are not a dreamer .
FriendsFest : The comedy show that gives us serious lessons about men 's friendships .
The lack of similar representations in shows is obvious , especially in view of the fact that the need for men to open is now even more desperate than ever before , such as suicide attacks among young men over a 15-year period .
In 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men from 20 to 45 in the United Kingdom , and it remains three times for men than women .
In an effort to address the problem , the Campaign Against Living Miserable -LRB- Calm - Campaign against a wretched life -RRB- 2015 announced the year of the man , with the aim of questioning the culture that is preventing men from looking for help when they need it .
Friendship is at the heart of the struggle to master this challenge .
A recent study of more than 2,000 high-school students with depressive symptoms found that if the suffering had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with `` healthy mood , '' his chances of recovery doubled .
For those who are not depressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends halves the risks of mental problems .
But of course you first have to have friends so that a friendship can work .
In the age of social media communication , with its focus on style about substance , the immediacy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact .
Our digital life doubles the need to appear strong , liveable and successful , even if , in reality , isolation is dominated .
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call values ; money , image , social status , everything at the expense of intrinsic values - our inner yearning for personal development and friendship , which has a much deeper impact on our mental health .
And , as a video games inventor and billionaire explained recently , money really can not buy .
The beauty of Friends was that this focus was put on the head .
Each character was defined not by his work , but by his personality , which was characterised by the interaction as a friend .
The humour of Joey and Chandler 's frequent hubris , moments in the football watch in cosy armchairs and the yearning for Ross to Rachel - all of this came from the knowledge that men can refer to it in any case , even if they are often reluctant to explore their feelings in full .
Like an employee of telephone care , I said ... `` my listening role for people who feel depressed and they are self-directed , I really showed how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . ''
The men who contact us often feel unable to speak with friends .
The old saying `` I come with it '' has an enormous effect , such as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when you talk about problems openly .
Friends is one of the shows that comes to my mind when I try to offer more long-term response mechanisms .
She clearly presents the small moments of men 's friendship .
So much my objective outsider over the phone may help people in moments of despair , also to help , the long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
And so when you visit comedy Central FriendsFest with a completely redesigned setting for the day 's celebration of the day , why do n't you take your friends to a drink in Central Perk .
Or , even better , if you sit in Starbucks someone alone , give him a smile and say hello .
You never know what difference your friendship could make .
Friends are sent to Comedy Central from start to the end - the entire 236 episodes - for # FriendsFest
Di Maria meets to help PSG to crush Malmö
Angel Di Maria celebrates Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his hit against Malmö .
Di Maria makes his debut at the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PSG to participate in Malmö .
Here are the game report and the response to the game .
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani held course when Paris Saint-Germain started his Champions League Season with a very comfortable 2-0 victory against Malmö at the Prinzenparkstadion on Tuesday .
Di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League , PSG player , who launched the French champion , but then she missed a number of occasions before she finally raised her lead when Cavani scored a head ball in the 61st minute .
With Real Madrid and Schachtjor Donetsk also in group A , Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish champion , as they strive not only for the qualification of the K.O.-RT , but an improvement on the way to the quarter final in each of the last three campaigns .
But while she got the points , it was not a class game of Laurent Blancs 's team with Zlatan Ibrahimovics who missed the gate , and was later changed to his home team and against the club with which he already started his illustrious career in 1999 .
`` It 's not easy to win at home or out in the Champions League , so it 's a good start to win 2 : 0 , cause problems and look back to our opponents , even if there are certain things that we must perfect over the season , '' said Blanc .
This is a good omen .
We wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we have not yet reached one or two more gates .
After his injury , Ibrahimovic returned to one of three changes to the Paris team , which at the weekend was able to hold a 2 : 2 determined in their own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was released by Di Maria in the fourth minute .
The Argentine wings have been described as the man who can take the PSG to the next level in Europe when he was taken over by Manchester United last month , and he indicated why , when he went to Marco Verratti 's pass behind the defense of the city , he went to Johan Wiland in the long corner of the network .
But if anyone believed that PSG would achieve a great victory , that was disappointing .
Malmö , who beat Celtic in a Play-off to reach this stage , appeared in Anpiff with nine national players in the field and was with a five-man defense and two deep in the middle of the middle field .
But in addition to a shot of Nikola Djurdjic , who passed far to Kevin Trasted posts in the 34th minute , they offered little in the attack .
Instead , PSG itself was sometimes present , with some misfortunes and bad qualifications , not least from Ibrahimovic , who was patched in the first half of the five attempts alone and then abandoned after Cavani used it after the restart .
Nevertheless , he made a lot more skill when he played his fellow players , and it was a pass of Ibrahimovic , who turned Di Maria into a shooting , which was passed by Wiland in the 52nd minute at the post ...
The second gate finally fell to the hourly mark , thanks to Cavani , which achieved its sixth season gate after Ibrahimovic had fished a left flank of Maxwell .
This ended all the thoughts of the fact that Malmö could come back to the game , and only an excellent intervention by Wiland to stop David Luiz , the final result was low before a replacement player , Ezequiel Lavezzi , was defeated .
The trainer of Malmö , Age Hareide , announced later that PSG played a class about his team , and the Norwegian said : Our last Champions League match was in December last year .
Since then , we have only played in the Swedish League , which does not have the same standard .
Skills games are not enough .
Hats off to Paris !
It was a great game of them !

Xavi : PEP Guardiola prevented a change to the FC Bayern in 2008 .
The world and European champion Xavi has been playing for the al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015 .
A few years ago , the FC Bayern was clearly close to the commitment of Spain 's superstar Xavi , who played for the FC Barcelona at the time .
Eight times , Spanish champions , three times of poker winner , four times of Champions League , two times , club champions , two times of European champion , one time , World Champion - the title list of Xavi is breathtaking .
In summer , the now 35 year-old left the FC Barcelona after 24 years , moving to the al-Sadd Sport Club to Qatar .
But in an interview with the Marca Xavi , Xavi now reveals that he was already before the em of 2008 before the departure from Barcelona .
`` I said that Barça wanted to sell me . ''
`` Madrid won everything , we had nothing , '' he says .
And that is also the name of the FC Bayern .
Xavi : `` There was an offer by Bavaria . ''
`` Rummenigge wanted to have me . ''
As a reminder : In the summer of 2008 Jürgen Klinsmann took over the FC Bayern .
Guardiola was the reason that Xavi did not change
However , the change was not achieved .
And the decisive man works today for the German record master : PEP Guardiola .
Xavi explains why : `` Barça has Guardiola under contract and I played a great em . ''
`` PEP told me that I would not switch that he could not imagine the team without me . ''
`` He has got me . ''
Who knows how Bavaria 's 2008 / 2009 season would have gone with Xavi .
Xavi stood for Barca in the quarter of the Champions League against the Bavarian over the entire distance of the pitch , divided the Red -LRB- 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 -RRB- and celebrated the premier triumph at the end .
Matt Damon plays a diverse role in the film industry
Matt Damon confronted African-American filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion about diversity and said that she was not needed behind the scenes .
During a sequence of Sunday Night by HBOS Project Greenlight , the experienced actor Brown broke the need for alternative perspectives in relation to a black protagonist in the project 's chosen script .
`` When we talk about diversity , you do it in the occupation of the film and not in the occupation of the show , '' Damon said .
Brown was shocked by the fact that he had a treasured unbelief and called `` Hoo ! '' when the comments of The Martian 's acting were consolidated .
Damon and Brown joined the producer fellow Ben Affleck and the Farrella brothers to discuss the show finalists .
`` I would like to ask people to reflect on this - whoever will be the director - as they treat the figure of Harmony , '' said Brown .
The only black person , and she is a Nutte who is beaten by her white pimp .
The producer of Dear White People , for the finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the racing rights of the film , replied that their direction `` could give us something we do n't want . ''
After the discussion was broadcast , the social media exploded against Damon 's comments .
Twitter users , Mr Pooni , expressed his anger over the clip by saying that `` Matt Damon speaks about the only black person in the room , so he can explain her variety - that 's so white that it hurts . ''
The tweet earned more than 5,000 reweets and 4,000 Likes since his release .
Damon 's comments come at a time when accurate racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social debate .
After a white police officer killed Michael Brown in 2014 , the Black Lives movement had an impact nationally and urged legislators and authorities to stop discriminatory practices against color control .
In February the singer Prince made a reference to the movement during the launch of the nominated albums of the year at the Grammy Awards .
`` album still matter , '' -LRB- albums still have their meaning -RRB- he said .
Like books and black life , albums still have their meaning .
More recently , leaders of the Black Lives movement have published a statement , in response to the question of the Fox News-personality Elisabeth Hasselbeck , whether the group should be seen as a hate group .
`` The Network Black Lives Matter is a love group , '' said the leaders .
It was recently announced that Damon was on a list of entertainers , producers and media moguls who were invited to visit the Pope to discuss the presentation of the Catholic Church in the West .
Whether he has accepted the invitation or has already met the Pope , it is unclear .
`` American Ninja warrior '' is the first champion
Professional sports climbers and operator support , Isaac Caldiero , became the first athlete who won the American NINJA warrior on Monday evening and won the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
The competition show , which just closed its 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who could complete all the steps of his obstacle course .
During the season finals , two men , Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten came to the final .
The last task was to climb on a 75 foot climbing rope in 30 seconds .
He was the first athlete who completed the exhausting phase 4 of the American NINJA warrior , but Caldiero finished this challenge for a full three seconds , which made him the winner .
Caldiero spoke with E ! News after the hard-won victory , still under the shock about the win of the Great prize of $ 1 million .
`` I think it is amazing to think about it , I have never earned more than $ 10,000 , '' said Isaac E !
Very suddenly .. as I can not even imagine what this is ... the future is unknown .
The lead producer Kent Weed moved to The Hollywood reporter to discuss the final and why he did not receive any prize money , although he first finished the course at all .
According to the rules the money goes to the fastest person .
`` If there is more than one finalist , it gets the fastest time , '' said Weed .
How much the money is a wonderful price and the life has changed , it gains great stability .
I do not believe that he has any resentment .
He is just as happy to have done what he has done .
Masses of awards he was awarded by fans .
He is such a great guy and a family father .
He is a hero of his children and his wife .
Geoff said to me : `` If I should be beaten by someone , then I am glad that it is Isaac . ''
And I think that Isaac would have felt the same if they had swayed the reels .
America NINJA warrior was extended for an eighth season , the filming will start in the spring of 2016 .
Detroit Tiger Tiger 's End to Minnesota twins
MINNEAPOLIS -- The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tigers .
In the past , they were one of the best teams in baseball , and today the tigers are on the final part of the American League Central .
The Tigers are reduced to their role as spoiler , but on Tuesday this part played perfectly against the Minnesota twins with 5-4 in Target Field .
The twins wasted an opportunity to rise in a half of the Houston Astros for the second American League Wildcard Square .
For Detroit , if only for one night , it was a return of the three letter F-word , which was so difficult to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season .
`` All victories are fun , as it comes , '' said Tiger Manager Brad Ausmus .
Tiger pitcher Alfredo Simon maintained his early offensive support , when Detroit scored three times in the first two Innings , once in the sixth and then once in the ninth .
Simon -LRB- 13-9 -RRB- beat 6 times in the 1 / 3 Innings and allowed three runs to run .
It was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
`` I want to end this year , '' Simon said .
It is difficult to play any game in the bullpen , and that is why I want to focus on the game .
The designer Tiger-Hitter Victor Martinez had three hits and was in two runs , his first RBIs since mid-August .
It was Martinez 's first triple hit game since he had four hits against the Seattle Navy on July 6 .
`` He has cut the headwood well , '' said Ausm .
He looked well in the -LRB- stroke training -RRB- , looked much better in the bullpen , and he brought it directly into play .
With three runs at the end of the seventh interior , the twins had their best chance to get back into play .
Center Fielder Byron Buxton finished the inning with a double at the left field line .
Right Fielder Aaron Hicks reached a colorful , and Simon brought his second baseman Brian Dozier to Strikeout before he was replaced by the left-handed Blaine Hardy .
Hardy overran Wall , the only man with whom he was confronted , in front of the nominated rookie Miguel sano , who broke a Two-Run .
With a pair of runners and the final race at the second , Verhagen brought the third Baseman Trevor Plouffe into a double play .
It was the first season in the Major League this season , that Plouffe proposed a Double Play
After Detroit added an Insurance-Run at the end of the ninth Innings , Wall made a RBI double against the Closer of the Tiger Bruce Rondon and scored the stand of 5-4 .
The right side of the right is sano , with three pitch for his fifth Save .
Detroit benefited from a non-mobile Phil Hughes at the start of the game .
The tigers reached three runs in the first two Innings against the right-wing veteran who had been removed from the injury list before the match , after he had been lacking for more than a month because of a back hold .
`` Indeed , not the beginning I wanted , '' Hughes said , `` but I felt more comfortable than I was and felt that I would create some pretty good pitch in the third inning . ''
After they got the lead blast in the first , Hushes gave a single to Second Baseman Ian Kinsler .
A two-out walk for J.D. Martinez hit Victor Martinez , who made a single `` up the middle '' at the first run of the game .
Victor Martinez made his 0-21 series of success with the Runners in the scoring position .
The third baseman Nick Castellanos followed with a single on the right , made another run , but Victor Martinez was thrown out of the game when he tried to reach the third , which ended the threat .
The tigers appeared in the second , reached a one-out double from Catcher James McCann and a two-out single from Center-Fielder Anthony Gose to 3-0 .
`` That was a big blow , '' said Twins-manager Paul Molitor .
He has not been particularly good , but he caught the right job .
Hughes was in a pitch count , did not reach any points in the third inning before he was replaced by A.J.Achter .
At Hughes there were three runs for six hits and a walk with four strikeouts .
Comments : Tiger RHP Anibal Sanchez disappeared due to a violation of the worm guilty .
He is examined by Dr. James Andrews , who operated the shoulder of Sanchez in 2007 .
Sanchez , since the middle of August on the injury list , should be activated for the start on Wednesday .
With Sanchez from the game , LHP Daniel Morris is removed from the injury list to start against the twins .
Norris with 1-1 at four starts with the tiger since he was acquired in exchange with LHP David Price on July 30
He has been lacking since 20 August because of a defeat in the right hip joint .
The Tiger and the twins will finish their series of three games in the Target Field on Wednesday .
Norris -LRB- 2-2.4.43 ERA -RRB- will be played against Minneapolis RHP Ervin Santana -LRB- 5-4 , 4.73 -RRB-
Hundreds of refugees are supposed to fall in Wiesbaden
A train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to Hesse .
His arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
The people there are to be accommodated in temporary shelters in Wiesbaden , such as the City of Wiesbaden on Tuesday evening .
It was in charge of 450 to 750 incoming refugees .
Several sports halls of the Hessian capital had been prepared for this case over the past few days .
Up to 1000 refugees can temporarily stay there .
They will then be distributed to other local authorities .
In the past ten days alone , according to the government presidency responsible for the initial recording , 7500 people have arrived in Hesse .
Because of the large number of refugees , Frankfurt and Hanau have also set up emergency accommodation in sports halls .
Ecuador : German military action in Syria No 1
The head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Ischinger , holds military action with German involvement in Syria .
`` I believe that firm reflection on military options for action can not take place without Germany , '' he said .
He accused the European states of `` collective understanding . ''
Four years ago , we were pleased that the Kelch passed a military participation in Germany .
`` Now the conflict ends at our doorstep , '' he said in the German radio .
The former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid to the refugees .
Austria on Southern and Eastern Limits
After Germany , Austria has again introduced controls at its southern and eastern borders .
The Austrian Minister for Home Affairs , Johanna MiklBertner , said on Tuesday evening at the Austrian television station ORF , that no one is being sent back to Hungary .
Germany has not returned refugees to Austria .
`` No , that is agreed , '' she explained .
On the question of an agreement after which Germany could take up a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , Mikl-tner said that there has already been talks between the Director-General for Public Safety and representatives of Germany .
Specific figures did not mention them and referred to discussions on Wednesday in Berlin .
In recent days , tens of thousands of refugees have come to Austria through the so-called Balkan route .
Their goal is usually Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel -LRB- CDU -RRB- and her Austrian colleague Werner Faymann , together with several other EU leaders , asked for a special summit next week .
Germany started on Sunday with temporary border controls .
So far , the EU countries have not been able to agree on a common approach to the crisis .
At a special meeting next Tuesday -LRB- 22 September -RRB- , the EU Interior Minister want to launch a new approach to the mandatory distribution of 120 000 refugees .
In the face of the strong line of refugees in Germany , the Federal Government wants to give more support to the countries to absorb and distribute people .
The Federal Government will manage this together with the countries , Merkel announced in the late Tuesday evening the prime minister 's discussions with the prime ministers at the chancellor in Berlin .
Merkel stressed that those people who need protection would also get it .
But anyone who does not have a lead perspective can not remain in Germany either .
This view was emphatically shared in the round .
The Chancellor stressed that the state as a whole must now deal with a `` huge effort of strength . ''
Thousands of desperate refugees are now on the Balkan route .
On Tuesday , Hungary closed its 175 kilometres of border with Serbia .
A few hours later , in Budapest , the government announced that the border with Romania would be overturned by a fence .
Unlike Serbia , this neighbouring country is part of the EU .
Hungary wanted to prevent traffickers from looking for escape routes over Romania , said Hungary 's Foreign Minister , Peter Szijjarto , on the planned new border fence .
The Romanian Government immediately condemned the plan .
There were first arrests of people who had cut the fence .
In Turkey , meanwhile , thousands of other migrants came to the Greek border .
Rooms `` Cassini '' find ocean on Saturnmond Enceladus
Under the ice cream of Saturnmond Enceladus , a global ocean drifts .
This fills researchers from the observations of the space probe `` Cassini . ''
Thus , the moon is easy to slip on its orbit around the ring planets .
This deafening movement is only small , but too large for a consistently solid celestial body , it is called in a communication from the Cornell University in ITHACA -LRB- U.S. State of New York -RRB- of Tuesday .
The researchers present their analyses in the `` Icarus '' magazine .
Even longer it was known that there must be liquid water under the ice of Enceladus .
In 2006 , `` Cassini '' discovered ice volcanoes at the south pole of the Saturn moon , spreading water vapour and ice particles , feeding the so-called E-Ring of the Saturn .
At least on the South Pole , there must be an underground sea , astronomers concluded .
However , the expansion of the hidden ocean was not clarified .
In 1860 , Rama was in Munich for several weeks .
The 1860 Munich has to give up about a month on open actor Valdet Rama .
An investigation has resulted in an induction injury in the 27-year-old , the club said .
Rama had complained about pain earlier this week .
According to Munich lions , the diagnosis `` is expected to be four weeks of forced break . ''
`` We are tough , Rama is a herber loss . ''
`` Of course we must now consider , '' said Sports Director Necat Aygün of the `` picture '' newspaper with a view to the possible obligation of a unified professional .
As a training guest , however , the sixties presented a defensive man .
The 30 year old Hrvoje Cale was active in Belgium and was already under contract with VfL Wolfsburg .
The Kroate currently has `` the chance to prove his skills . ''
Torhunter Rubin Okotie can return to man training next week after his brain attack .

But , contrary to his first fears , he remained without a serious blessur .
No diet fruit - Mangos contain a lot of sugar
Mangoes are exotic and juicy sweet .
But if you want to take care of your slim line , you will often get out of it .
Because mangoes contain relatively much sugar - especially sucrose .
However , the exotic fruits are healthy : In them , B vitamins as well as the vitamins E and C. above all include mangoes , but vitamin A and its pre-stage beta-carotene .
Those who eat the fruit thus support vision , immune system and metabolic processes in the body .
When buying , mangoes should not be too soft or too firm and pleasant to smell .
The shell colour alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so green mangoes can also taste a very delicious taste .
They should be stored at room temperature and should be consumed within a few days .
Then you can taste it in a pure or sweet way .
A mango , however , also gives a special touch to hearty dishes .
It relieves the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads like Chicoree and Radiccio .
And a mangochutney fits well with fish , poultry , lamb and game .
For the Christmas business in the United States , the US package service UPS again offers up to 95,000 supplements .
The company has already started recruiting seasonal workers , said UPS on Tuesday .
In particular , drivers are being searched .
Last year , UPS had increased its workforce for the holiday season of 95000 relief .
In view of the booming online business , UPS and its competitor , Fedex , have been making arrangements for the Christmas business last year .
In 2013 , late deliveries had brought harsh criticism to the package services .
First of all , there was a rush , then a clear cold front .
In the coming night , in the valleys of the alpine side , the hair dryer breaks through , as the MeteoSwiss told us on Tuesday .
On Wednesday and in the night on Thursday the hair dryer blows partly with storm strength through the valleys .
After the end of the Thursday morning , a prominent cold front crosses us , causing heavy rain , wind and a temperature drop .
As MeteoNews writes in a communication , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low pressure area across the British Isles in a powerful southwest flow .
On the alpine side , in the night to Wednesday the hair dryer breaks through the valleys .
As a result , the hair dryer blows from 60 to 100 km / h in the valley from 60 to 100 km / h , and in some cases , especially in the Urnerland , with more than 100 km / h .
The hair dryer can penetrate into the adjacent Mittelland , and on the mountains it is possible to reach the gates of more than 120 km / h .
While in the north , on Wednesday , the summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees are high , the humidity of the Alpensüd slope begins .
There is a rain that lasts until Thursday evening .
In total , in the next 48 hours , in the south of the Alps , a total of more than 100 litres of rain per square metre is expected to occur in the last few days .
On Thursday morning the hair dryer is on the air , and in the end a cold front with a strong , partial rain goes from west to east over Switzerland .
Together with the cold front , the wind refreshes the wind , and the temperatures go back sharply .
The following days are presented in the north with 15 to 20 degrees , but in the south it will be sunny and warmer with up to 25 degrees .
Rome Now has a Martini Square
Almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martini Square in Rome .
In the presence of city president Ignazio Marino , a nameless place in the park on the Oppius hill was baptised on Wednesday on the name of the German reformer .
In the `` Piazza Martin Lutero '' he is now credited as the `` German theologique of the Reformation . ''
The park is located in the middle of the old Rome , right next to the Coliseum .
The name was requested by the working community of the Protestant churches in Rome .
Jens-Martin Kruse , pastor of the Evangelical community in Rome , recalled on Wednesday that the Protestants in the city of passports could often only live in secret for centuries as a minority .
It will symbolically show that its tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome .
Martin Luther -LRB- 1483-1546 -RRB- was in Rome for a few months in Rome at the turn of 1510 / 11 .
At the time , he received the city as a lost scapegoat .
His negative impressions are likely to have reinforced him in his later struggle against Rome , in the view of historians .
Luther then embarked on the division of the Western Church with his theses against the Ablasan trade .
Hammer artists invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible .
Jesus is one of the main works that Otmar Alt has painted for his Bible .
Klaus Altepost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts .
At the beginning was the word ?
No , not at the Otmar-Alt-Bibel , which has now appeared with magnificent images .
In the beginning was the picture for Otmar Alt , who in 150 motifs formulated his personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas .
His `` language '' with colourful colours and imaginative forms has received the 75-year-old - but this is not synonymous with `` funny '' images .
On the contrary , in line with the subjects concerned , this can be quite bleak .
For about three years , Otmar Alt has worked on his Bible Project , for which he has taken a subjective artistic choice from the many themes of the `` book of all books . ''
The results are cycles that focus on topics such as crosses , pages , commandments , or faits .
As a result , he spontaneously fascinated several partners : This applies to the Luther publishing house with its theological orientation as well as to the Kettler-Verlag with its focus on art books .
And there is , above all , the author Klaus Altepost , who has dealt with the respective Bible points on the basis of painting .
He has interpreted the Bible positions selected by Otmar Alt and , in this way , `` translated '' into the current context .
These texts are like verbal mirrors of Alts 's painting .
They are embedded between the original Bible of Martin Luther and each one of the artist , who formulates his own personal thoughts about the situation .
The jewelry band has golden letters .
Thus , the 75-year old allows double a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
This is a high level of intimacy .
Emotions were ultimately the trigger for the Bible project : Otmar Alt , born in Wernigerode in 1940 and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant Herrnhuter Order .
`` Because the upbringing happened with the cane , '' Otmar Alt remembers .
`` I tried to do this , perhaps also to get back to the Lord Father . ''
His second concern is to give more importance to art in the fast-paced time : The perception of visual worlds is now marked by advertising , and that is loud .
Symbolism is being displaced .
Artists have a different desire to show things .
Pictures are always secret and are not decorative .
`` In this respect , I am a dinosaur . ''
Otmar Alt wants the viewer to `` fall '' into the images , let them work on themselves , discover and feel the strength they have : `` The image is looking for its counterpart . ''
On Tuesday at the presentation of the Otmar-Alt-Bibel in the Otmar-Alt-Bibel in the `` Otmar Alt-Bibel Foundation , '' a lover of Otmar Alt 's art : `` I like how he understands life with his pictures . ''
Old have not been careful not to capture the Bible completely , but to choose the subjects that are important to him , as well as mysterious subjects .
`` This was not a cooperation on an equal footing , '' says Altepost : `` This is about the pictures , the text explains only , '' says a picture Bible .
For Hans Möhler of the Luther publisher , this work is an invitation to `` deepen his life and find freedom . ''
Otmar Alts 's pictures speak both the -LRB- biblical -RRB- language of love and responsibility .
A part of the originals - paper and canvas images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition opened on 15th November at the Otmar-Alt-Stiftung Foundation .
Construction start for the BMX track
Plans were made , space was found , companies were asked to model for a round track : A year later , almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BMX track it was a good start .
Failures in politics and administration led to a decline , especially among the residents who did not want to tolerate the railways .
So take a hill , find a new place - now with formal planning and a request for construction permission .
The permission will be received in October , and the First Councillor Sabine Mosebach-Bock could now announce the date in the Children and Youth Committee .
`` I hope this year will still be visible , '' she said .
It should then begin with the work of the former indoor swimming pool without `` further pause for remembrance . ''
DFB is intensifying engagement for refugees
The DFB is expanding its commitment to refugees until 2019 , and the Bundesliga is showing a clear signal at the weekend .
Football responds to the worsening situation in Germany and ensures its help in dealing with the problems we are facing .
`` I think this is the greatest challenge for our country since reunification . ''
`` In principle , nobody can say that I have nothing to do , I have nothing to do . ''
`` This must be interesting to every individual to get this issue under control , '' said DFB-chef Wolfgang .
At the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin on 23 September , he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively .
`` I am in the chancellor 's office next Wednesday and meet the Minister of State , Mrs Özoğuz , and the Chancellor . ''
`` Because the issue will certainly play a central role , '' he announced .
Football can and can help .
However , the decisive course must be the policy .
The German Football League has therefore extended its refugee initiative `` 1 : 0 for a welcome '' by four years .
`` About the Egidius-Braire Foundation , we have ensured that this programme will continue until 2019 , '' declared kidney at the margins of the UEFA Council in St. Julian 's / Malta .
Some federal ligists also support this program .
As early as this weekend , the 36 professional clubs send a clear signal if they are going to wear the print on the left tricot instead of the usual sponsor logo -LRB- Hermes -RRB- .
`` We also want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can only help , '' said Sports chef Rudi Völler of the `` Bild '' newspaper -LRB- Tuesday -RRB- and called the project `` self-evident . ''
`` The refugee tragedy goes to everyone , none of them can see away . ''
`` We are able to be a football fan , no , we need to use our blasting power , our influence and our ability to help the many refugees who have already suffered such incredible damage , '' said Hertha-Manager Michael Preetz .
Hoffenheim 's managing director , Peter Rettig , spoke of a `` prominent sign of the league . ''
On this Friday the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Saale .
`` A big European work of German football '' described the support of refugees as `` a large piece of German football . ''
It is excellent that all 36 licensed clubs have launched their own projects in their places .
Equally great is the fact that small and smallest clubs are active .
The message `` 1 : 0 for a Welcome '' that we have spent is living in football .
`` That is of enormous importance , '' he said .
In this and next year , the association , together with the DFB and the Federal Government , will provide EUR 300 000 for the integration of refugees .
`` The clubs have already taken up all the total for 2015 , '' reported kidney .
Reports : SAP Board of Staff loses an eye in the event of an accident
The CEO of Europe 's largest software company , Bill McDermott , according to several reports , lost the left eye at the beginning of July .
In the event of an accident in the house of his brother in the USA , after midnight , he fell on a water glass , which he carried in the left hand , reports the `` economic week '' on Wednesday .
`` He is almost empty , he was powerless , but he then passed away on the street - he told us last week , '' quoted the `` WiWhere '' SAP co-founder Hasso Plattner .
But McDermott could carry out his work .
`` At the beginning of October we meet us in front of the supervisory board in Walldorf , '' said Plattner .
The 54 years old manager was `` fully operational '' at the meeting .
McDermott announced in an interview with the `` Süddeutsche Zeitung '' -LRB- Thursday edition -RRB- that he will come back to Germany in October and will continue to lead the software group .
`` I 'm full of SAP , full in my job . ''
`` Of course I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its Chairman Hasso Plattner , '' said McDermott of the `` SZ . ''
McDermott usually oscillates between Germany and the USA , but since summer he was no longer present at the German SAP headquarters in Walldorf .
It is important to him to go to the public with such a personal story , said the manager of `` SZ '' : `` Everyone can happen something like that . ''
`` It is important to stand up again when you have fallen . ''

Football : BVB without Reus against Krasnodar : Weidenfeller in the Gate
At Borussia Dortmund , all hopes for a comeback of Marco Reus in the first group game of the Europa League have finally been broken .
The national player will also miss the table leader of the football league in the duel with the FK Krasnodar on Thursday -LRB- 7 p.m. / Sky -RRB- .
`` We can not use it , unfortunately , '' said Thomas Tuchel on Wednesday .
Whether Reus will take place on Sunday in the Bundesliga top match against Leverkusen , the BVB Coach was open : `` We reckon with a return from him to the training on Friday . ''
In the face of the high pressure of its professionals , Tuchel will not only change its stockpile on the reverse position .
So he announced a change to the goalkeeper position .
This is why Roman Weidenfeller takes up the place of master keeper Roman Bürki .
`` He trains at an absolute top level , '' praised the football teacher .
However , in the future , Tuchel has been able to compete in all European League games in the future .
It is highly likely that he will play the second game .
In the second half of the year , the team will be participating in the first round of events in the European Championship .
`` I think we have a good chance to take the title . ''
Robotic Cars : Government wants to lead the way for Germany
Germany , after the will of the Federal Government , should be the technological leader in the change of cars .
On Wednesday , the Federal Cabinet adopted a strategy paper from the House of Transport Ministers , Alexander Dobrindt -LRB- CSU -RRB- , which provides for investment in the development of digital infrastructure , among other things .
Dobrindt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the outskirts of the Automesse IAA from a `` new mobility age . ''
The automated and networked driving will increase road safety and reduce congestion , said Dobrindt .
He also wants to discuss the issue with his counterparts from the G7 countries , who also meet with representatives of the industry at the IAA .
The Ministry of Transport 's strategy paper highlights , among other things , the importance of mobile broadband and a rapid shift on digital radio .
For the testing of new technology there is currently a test track on the highway 9 in Bavaria .
In order to ensure that no additional risk of liability is imposed on the driver , the Federal Government wants to `` review and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . ''
For example , Germany wants to make an international commitment to raising the permitted maximum speed for self-driving cars from 10 to 130 kilometres per hour .
The Federal Government also wants to promote a change to the Vienna Convention , which has so far only provided for the people as drivers .
In the case of automated driving , the car is increasingly taking the lead , the driver is becoming more and more so to the passenger .
The technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data in seconds .
According to a study presented by the Ministry of Economics , highly automated driving on motorways will be technically possible by 2020 .
Nevertheless , driver-free vehicles on public roads `` to expect only after 2020 . ''
Added value in the area of driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions at the Germany site value the authors of the study to around EUR 8.4 billion for 2025 .
`` The digital networking of the car can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road transport , '' said SPD Transport politician Sören Bartol .
However , the issue of liability in the event of accidents and the safety of drivers ' personal data must be clearly clarified .
However , the German self-propelled cars are still skeptical - much more than French or American .
A survey by the Forsa Institute , commissioned by the Forsa Institute on Wednesday , comes to the conclusion that only 8 % of Germans believe that autonomous cars will prevail over the next ten years , 32 % in 20 years , 31 % do not believe in it at all .
In France , 21 % of respondents reckon with autonomously mobile cars by 2025 , and 33 percent in the US .
In any case , drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely on a self-driving vehicle .
After a survey of the digital association Bitkom , only seven percent would agree to take control throughout the trip on all roads .
On the highway , the flowing traffic could present a total of 15 percent , and 45 % in congestion .
It would not be possible to leave control to the car under any circumstances .
Boll says Team- and Double start at Table Tennis
At the end of the year , the German Federal Ministry of Education and the Association of the German Federal Ministry of Education and the German Federal Ministry of Education and Education and the German Federal Ministry of Education and Rural Development , the German Federal Ministry of Education and the Association of the European People 's Party -LRB- Christian Democrats -RRB- and European Democrats , wants to make sure that they have the opportunity to participate in the event .
The final decision should be taken by 22 September at the latest .
`` This is a huge loss for our team . ''
`` The guys experienced it in the morning . ''
`` We are strong enough to get the title even without Timo , '' said Bundestag Jörg Roßkopf .
At this time , Boll was on the flight for a long-term sponsored sponsorship period in China .
The 34 year old German champion is expected on Friday .
`` Without Timo , the disadvantage is , we are no longer such a clear favorite , '' explained single European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov .
The Hamelner , who leads the betting list in Jekaterinburg , also recalled the em 2013 in Schwechat .
`` Virgin has also been missing from Timo , and we have become a European champion . ''
`` We should be guided by this , '' said the world ranking list .
The British football player , Luke Shaw of Manchester United , has suffered a serious injury on the right leg .
In the Champions League Game at PSV Eindhoven , the defender was hit by Héctor Moreno in a tactical tour and changed after long treatment .
The first diagnosis , in the 20 years of old players from Bastian swine , hinted at a rail break .
Gaultier feels too old for an Enfant Great
It is a mixture of a very big fashion show and a wax figure-play cabaret : The designer Jean Paul Gaultier -LRB- 63 -RRB- presented an exhibition about his work in Munich on Wednesday .
The highlights : Window windows which , thanks to video projects , look frighteningly human .
They wear the French designer 's spectacular creations , which , among other things , became the great star of the fashion scene with Madonnas , and the fact that he put men in skirts .
`` I can no longer say today that I am the Enfant State of Haute couture , because I have white hair . ''
`` In the past , it was easy , it is real , '' said Gaultier .
For the visitors of the exhibition `` From The Sidewalk to The Catwalk '' -LRB- the pavement on the catwalk -RRB- , which can be seen from 18 September at the Kunsthalle of Hypo-Kulturstiftung , it is fortunate that the fashion designer has changed his initial negative attitude to a show about his person .
In fact , he was against him because : `` For me an exhibition sounded a bit of death , '' he said .
When you die , you come into the museum .
The impressive collection had already taken place in the Canadian Montreal and in Paris .
`` It 's about so much more than just beautiful clothes , '' said the director of the Kunsthalle , Roger Diederen .
It is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
The exhibits give an insight into the hardly obvious work of the man who has written fashion history without ever having completed a training .
Chronologically , the show is not built , but it is an excellently choreographed artwork for which a lot of effort has been made : To eat the dolls , a stylist has been involved for example .
14 tons of material have been carried by the macher , according to the curator , Thierry-Maxime Loriot , after Munich .
Shortly before the start of the Oktoberfest , there was also a special delicacy : A leatherhosen outfit with a corset .
Heidi meets Madonna .
He has always been interested in strong women -LRB- `` women are smarter than men '' -RRB- and for people who are a bit different , Gaultier said .
Also Gaultier 's old teddy can be seen in the exhibition .
He stands for the first , tentative fashion attempts of the designer .
As a child -LRB- he was not a good student and bad in football -RRB- he attracted his teddy BHS and clothes , said Gaultier .
To play with a doll , his parents would not have allowed him .
He then brought himself to the end of fashion .
He made steel fashion magazines and saw the designs of other designers , such as Gaultier in Munich .
Later I bought them of course .
For his first own fashion show , he has not been able to pay the models .
They got nothing , but they were allowed to keep the clothes .
Jewelry instead of Gardine
Earlier it went to the long embroidery machines in and around chat to make meters .
The embroidered fabrics and tips were created in a great deal for customers , who for example made them to blankets and curtains .
This will no longer work today , explains Andreas Reinhardt , managing director of the fashion houses .
Instead , fashion is important again .
In the early days of the chat top , fashion played a larger role , was then replaced by the home textile industry - and is now discovered as a niche .
Reinhardt lists a number of examples : Lace in jewellery , accessories like bags and regional costumes .
At all , the so-called vintage fashion , which refers to past styles , is an increasing order potential .
Anyone who does not use niches in the textile industry in Germany is no longer on the market .
With us , they already make up half of all orders .
Modespitze Plauen is a member of the industry association with nine other companies .
Only they can carry the protected label .
In the last 15 years , around 80 % of turnover has been broken .
There is almost no longer any private business or wholesale business .
Our products hardly reach the customer in this way .
Today , the mass goods are being produced much more cheaply in the Asian region and distributed almost exclusively by chains .
Moreover , exports are weakening , currently in Russia and the US .
So there are enough reasons for new paths .
The industry association is also trying to see how Cordula Bauer is told by the Stickperle in Falkenstein : `` Since this year we have a quality seal that shows that we produce ecological and socially acceptable products . ''
Reinhardt adds : `` This also refers to the materials used . ''
Diploma designer Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schneeberger outsider at the Faculty of applied Arts at the Faculty of applied Arts and is specialized in embroidery and tips .
In order to counteract competition from Asia , you have to find high-quality and innovative products .
That takes time and courage .
There is a tension between the freshest ideas of the designers and the companies that have to think economically above all , says Schmidt .
Therefore , an existing design is often easily varied in order to keep a customer base .
A few years ago , Kati Reuter , the textile designer Kati Reuter , redesigned the historic snowball peak .
At some points , the machine creates small chunks .
The well-known Goldsmith Bianca Hallebach-Krauß was inspired by it : `` In the past I could not start with traditional old ones . ''
Now she is using the top of the snowball for her jewelry .
In an elaborate process it shapes the pattern in silver .
`` Many people of the region identify with the topic of chat top - young and old , '' says Reuter .
It also comes from the USA , Australia and Finland , especially to customers whose ancestors have lived in chat and surroundings and who want to have a piece of memory .
In this way , I see my jewelry as a modern ambassador of the top .
Disney plans new `` Mary Poppins '' ...
There is no legend , but Disney still dares to have a new film of his classic `` Mary Poppins . ''
However , according to `` entertainment Weekly , '' it is not a new film , but a kind of sequel , which plays 20 years after the first film with the magic nanny .
It is about the experience of Nanny with the family banks in times of the Great Depression in England .
Anyone who plays Poppins to Julie Andrews for more than 50 years is still unclear .
But the director is already certain : Rob Marshall , most recently with `` Into the Woods '' in the cinema .
XI urges us to open the economy more to the world
The economy needs to open more widely to promote growth , said President Xi Jinping , on Tuesday , a group charged with steering the reform .
`` China should strive to attract foreign investment and know-how and improve strategies for business start-ups , '' he said in an address at the 16th session of the Central Management Board for the deepening of a comprehensive reform .
Promoting new start-ups and driving reforms will bring about new momentum and vitality , and offer new space for economic growth , said Xi .
The management group has adopted a number of directives , including a negative list to regulate market access , relaxation of the border control policy , the promotion of state-owned enterprises -LRB- SOE -RRB- , private capital , and the overhaul of the resident reporting system .
After the statement , a negative list will be created , which identifies sectors and companies that do not qualify for investment .
The system is gradually being tested and improved by testing programs .
The initiative is important because it gives the market a greater role in the allocation of resources , ensures a legal business environment and makes the market more open , said the statement .
The government will also relax controls on the powers conferred on companies and ensure that companies decide how to do their business .
The statement also said that China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms for promoting regional growth .
Within the framework of an offer to open state-controlled sectors , further areas will be opened for private investment .
`` The government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of leveraged companies and provide better services for them , '' said the statement .
In addition , it will be easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the `` Green Card '' by optimising the requirements and facilitating the application process .
The right of lawyers to exercise their activities , and to use professional judges and prosecutors , was also discussed at a meeting .
At the meeting there were also Premier Li Keqiang and important leaders like Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli , as reported in a statement published after the meeting .
The EU wants to double the mercury limit on predators
The European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large predators and to give consumers a much higher dose of the nerve .
The consumer organisation Foodwatch , which has a corresponding EU working document , sharply criticised the plans : `` Risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policies are passed with full force on pregnant women and infants , '' said Matthias Wolfschmidt of Foodwatch .
According to Wolfschmidt , the limits of the nerve poison for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as shark or swordfish , should be raised from one kilogram to two milligrams of mercury per kilogram of fish , such as shark or swordfish .
However , large predators are already so heavily burdened with mercury , which means that approximately 50 % of catches can not be sold on the basis of existing limit values .
After the doubling of the limit values , only 14.5 percent would then be sold .
In exchange for this relaxation , the EU , according to the Foodwatch , wants to tighten the limit values for other fish from the current 0.5 milligrams to 0.1 milligrams of mercury per kilogram .
But Foodwatch described this as a `` trick , '' because smaller cemetfish , such as carp , are mostly so low , that they are already complying with the planned maximum levels today .
For this reason , the reduction in small amounts is `` a perfidious deflection tactic that helps the economy alone , '' Wolfschmidt explained .
Mercury is a heavy metal that is highly toxic to humans , which is heavily enriched by the food chain , especially in predators .
For this reason , the Federal Government warns that `` already little amounts can lead especially to unborn damage to the nervous system . ''
The Federal Ministry of the Environment , in view of the current maximum values , states that a `` health risk for the general population '' can not be expected .
Mercury reaches the environment , especially through coal combustion .
According to a written information from the Federal Ministry of Environment , the German coal-fired power plants emit more than six tons of mercury per year , two thirds of the total emitted in Germany .
The concentration of mercury in fish , for example in the Elbe , the Rhine and the Danube , is `` permanently and widely exceeded , '' the `` mirrors '' had been quoted from paper in March .
Last year , Europe-wide warnings about mercury in fish were already the most common health risks in the EU warning system RASFF .
Foodwatch calls on consumers to protest against the plans of the EU : Www.qumercury - Futwatch.de
